//*************** UI Design Principles - November 15th, 2017 ****************//
//**************************************************************************//

- So, we were talking about "affordances" at the end of yesterday: things we can do to give our users hints on what to do
    - One thing we have to watch out for are FALSE AFFORDANCES: things that make the user THINK they're supposed to do something, when they're actually supposed to do something else

- Another UX principle is CONSTRAINTS, where we convey what the app can/can't do in the app
    - A SUPER common example: graying out buttons until it's time to perform an action
    - "If you're making something for international use, make sure that these aren't just cultural conventions (e.g. that green and red mean the same thing in all the countries you're releasing in)"

- ACCESSIBILITY - watch out for red/green color blindness, allowing for screen readers, text enlargement for visually impaired people, etc.

- Finally, a few general rules for UI design:
    - The UI should assist the user, not become another task to learn
    - Must not make the user feel stupid
    - Must not make the computer appear stupid
    - Visibiility of system status
    - Match between the system and real-world
    - Allows for user control and freedom
    - Be consistent and follow standards
    - The UI should help prevent errors
    - Recognition rather than recall (UNIX is very recall-dependent; you just have to remember all the bash commands)
        - "UNIX is actually user-friendly...it's just picky about who its users are"
    - Flexibility and efficiency of use
    - Fitting and non-distracting aesthetic design
    - Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
    - Provide help and documentation through design
    - Avoid modal windows when possible (i.e. windows that don't let you click on another window)
    - Eventual vs immediate honesty
        - Immediate honesty means that you show the user if something worked IMMEDIATELY, right away (e.g. a window pops up saying "Failed to add new report")
            - This is the one we usually prefer
        - Eventual honesty means that there's a way to see if something worked, but you have to do some extra steps (e.g. going back to the "Files" page to see if your file was added)

- So, those are things we should be thinking about for designing a UI...but how do we actually evaluate if one UI design is better than another?
    - Usually, you'd do this stuff for homework in M11, but we cut that for time due to the hurricane
        - The three parts for this homework: Plan, execute review, report changes you think should be made
- Now, once we have multiple designs, there are a few techniques we can use:
    - formative vs summative
    - with or without end-user testing
    - using a variety of prototypes
        - Specifically, three techniques we'll look at: heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough, think-aloud observation
            - "These are designed to evaluate different things, so we can happily use all of these"
- Remember: we're evaluating the DESIGN of the app in this stage, NOT the functionality!

- HEURISTIC EVALUATION:
    - Have a small set of evaluators independently examine an interface, and judge it based on the general rules-of-thumb that exist for UI
        - If you go to "Usability Stuff" folder on T-Square, there's a toolkit for what to be looking for during a UI test, and specifically an "HE Checklist"
    - This is mainly formative and qualitative; has the advantage that you do NOT need a fully working prototype to evaluate individual screens, relatively straightforward ("Heck, you could use some paper printouts to evaluate it")
    - The procedure (created by Jakob Nielsen):
        1) Gather inputs (screens/scenarios you want to test)
        2) Independent evaluation
            - INDEPENDENT! This isn't a code review where you should be filling this out with your team; do it on your own!
            - How many evaluators should there be? Well, there's diminishing returns here; 5 people are enough to catch about 75% of the errors, and after 15 people you have to add a LOT more people to get better results
            - What counts as a usability bug? Whatever you think it is! A confusing button, a color you don't like, etc.
        3) Debriefing/collection (get the reports from the evaluators)
        4) Severity rating (how well did the app fare?)
            - How often did a problem come up? Does the problem have a mjor impact on users, or is it just a nusiance? Would it affect the market impact of the app? Is it a persistent issue or just a learning curve?
            - Severity ranking: from 0 (this isn't even a problem) to 4 (catastrophic, makes the app almost unusable)
- COGNITIVE WALKTHROUGH:
    - Basically, this technique is saying "as a novice, how well can I use this app if I know nothing about it?"
    - What a "novice user" means is different from app-to-app; a professional movie-editing app will have different users than a grandma-friendly pet shop website

- We'll finish going over this next time</pre>
