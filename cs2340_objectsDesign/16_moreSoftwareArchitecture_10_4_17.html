<pre>//****************************************************************************//
//*********** Software Architecture (cont.) - October 4th, 2017 *************//
//**************************************************************************//

- "The first thing you should do when you're adding a new technology to your 
app, e.g. Firebase, is to Google something like 'android firebase architecture 
best practices', to make sure you're organizing things in the best way possible"
    
- Some more architectural styles:
    - Layered Architecture
        - We have a bunch of layers, like "Presentation", "Application 
        Control", "Business Services," "Technical Services", etc., and each of 
        our domain objects goes into one of the layers; each layer can only 
        communicate with the layer immediately above and below it,
        - This makes it really easy to change out things; if we want to change 
        the UI, we only need to change the UI layer, and nothing else!
            - "There's a LOT of different ways to setup the layers, depending 
            on your needs"
            - Example: WinZip, the Windows program that handles 
            zipping/unzipping files, uses this architecture
    - Enterprise Architecture
        - When you work on software for HUGE companies like IBM, Coca-Cola, 
        etc., in the old days, we would build a bunch of small "stovepipe" 
        systems that were all independent of each other, e.g. Flight Operations 
        would have a program to log pilot hours, developed independently of 
        Maintenance's time-logging program, which was made separately from 
        Flight Management's flight scheduling system...
            - "Wouldn't it be nice if we could just enter in the same data 
            ONCE, and then have all of these systems TALK to one another?"
            - "EAA" is a good book on converting these "stovepipe" systems to 
            share data, but...
        - ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE is where we try and design from the ground-up 
        for this kind of interconnectivity. Until about 3-4 years ago, 
        service-oriented architecture was THE way to do this
            - The problem, though, is that this wasn't really a good fit for 
            Agile development, combining all of these massive pieces together
        - So, nowadays, the new buzz is around MICROSERVICES, where we have a 
        bunch of tiny operations (counting customers, etc.) and then tie them 
        together
            - "You don't need to know the details for this course, but just be 
            aware that Enterprise architecture is a huge thing out there in the 
            real world"

- If we were developing this app for the "real world", it'd probably use a 
combination of Client-Server architecture, MVC, and Layered architecture on the 
back-end; if we were tying it into NYC's larger sanitation program network, we 
might even bring in some Enterprise architecture techniques

- Control styles
    - "Now, this is less relevant for you guys, since Android kind of forces a 
    control style on you"
    - Generally, there are 3 big kinds:
        - Centralized
            - A few objects make all the decisions, and then direct the rest of 
            the objects to do those specific tasks
            - Generally, this is easier to debug, since problems are most 
            likely to pop up in the few coordinator objects, limiting what we 
            need to check
        - Dispersed
            - Objects work independently without any central direction
        - Delegated
            - This is a hybrid approach, where there are a couple coordinator 
            objects which each locally direct just a few objects underneath them
            - "This is more-or-less what Android forces on us, where we have a 
            controller class for each screen"

- So, how do we know if we've chosen a good architecture? How do we know it's a 
good fix? This is what we deal with in "Architectural Evaluation"
    - Some common techniques:
        - SAAM (what we will probably teach in this course)
        - ATAM (older, developed at CMU Software Engineering Institute)

- "Trust Boundary" is an overloaded term; in security, it means what we allow 
customers to use and access, etc...
    - That is NOT what we mean when we talk about "Trust Boundaries" in 
    architecture
    - Instead, TRUST BOUNDARY refers to what data we've ensured is validated 
    and is what it's supposed to be, e.g. making sure a "String" input is a 
    valid username, etc.
        - This relates to the idea of "defensive programming", where we're 
        writing code to protect from errors
    - e.g. In MVC, we might say "Alright, anything that comes from the 
    database, I'm going to assume is good and valid; BUT, anything that comes 
    from textboxes in the UI, I'm going to assume is SUSPECT, and needs to be 
    validated for SQL Injection, spelling errors, etc."
        - For these "untrusted collaborators", we usually need to take extra 
        precautions, like
            - Only passing along necessary data
            - Passing a COPY of a list, so if that list gets corrupted, our 
            database is still safe
            - Checking validation conditions 
            - Making objects read-only so they can't be broken
            - etc.

- Now, to represent the architecture, we'll be using UML Package Diagrams
    - We represent each compoenent of our architecture as a "file folder" icon
    - We'll show connections between each package using "dependency relations" 
    (other ways, but that's what we're using in this class)
        - "By dependency, we mean that a package uses methods or interfaces 
        defined in a different package"
    - You can read more about this in Chpt. 13 of the Larman book
