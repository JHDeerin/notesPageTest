//*********** Intro to Git/Version Control - August 30th, 2017 **************//
//**************************************************************************//

- So, for M1, someone'll need to create your GitHub site, and then create a 
repository for the project
- For ZENHUB, should get the extension for your browser and create the 
milestones listed in the homework
    - For issues, do NOT just make 4 issues called "m1", "m2", "m3", "m4"; LOOK 
    at what you need to do for those milestones and put in the specific stuff 
    to implement - "create team charter," "add user registration", etc., with 
    them ordered by priority (priority should be based on time when they're all 
    due) 
        - Then, create a sprint, assign your issues/milestones, etc.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- So, source/version control is a CS-specific type of engineering practice 
called "configuration management", which lets us keep track of our project and 
what we're doing
    - We're not going to go through all the specifics of configuration 
    management as a discipline; we'll just be focusing on one, specific aspect: 
    CONTROL

- Problem: how can multiple people work on the same code at the SAME TIME?
    - This used to be a REALLY big problem, and so you'd have techniques like 
    "one person - one file", copying files from a shared directory, token-based 
    "coke can" models (only 1 person can work on the same piece of code at the 
    same time), etc.
        - NOW, this problem has been WAYYYYYYYYY simplified with source 
        control, which automatically keeps track of ALL our changes and can 
        coordinate them!
        - Initially, this class started out with CVS, then switched to 
        Subversion, and now, we're currently using Git

- "Source control is a pain in the neck when you start learning to use it, but 
trust me, it'll be a MASSIVE help once you get used to it"

- Now, some decisions that we have to make as configuration managers is "what 
should we control?", "When do we control it?", "How do we stay in sync?", etc.
    - Git really only helps with the last part, but for this class, that's all 
    we really need; the rest of this is software engineering stuff that you 
    just have to decide for yourself

- So, let's cover the high-level theory of how version control works
    - In a CENTRALIZED system (like CVS, although Git has a mode that works 
    like this), there's a server on the internet called the "repository"
        - When Bob wants to look at the code, he "checks out" the code from the 
        repository, downloading it to his machine
        -Then, Bob works on the file(s) he downloaded LOCALLY; the 
        version-control system doesn't know anything has changed
        - Then, when Bob's done, he "commits" the file to the version-control 
        system. The repository updates the repository number to "version 2" or 
        something like that
        - Then, Sally wants to work on a file, so she checks it out...etc.
    - Now, what if you're BOTH working at the same time? And you both check out 
    "Version 37" or something...
        - Well, the FIRST person to commit will just have it smoothly update 
        the repo as normal
        - The SECOND person, though, who tries to commit from that same 
        codebase ("changes were also based on v.37") will have the repo tell 
        them that they'll need to "MERGE" their code to get it working
            - So, the 2nd person would actually have to "fetch" the changes the 
            1st person made, add their changes locally, then send a new update 
            to the repo
            - In  some cases, the software will be clever enough to 
            automatically merge (e.g. if we edited the same file but only added 
            things, didn't delete anything); if we changed the SAME LINES, 
            though, then the software isn't sure who's changes should take 
            precedence, and we'll have to manually resolve these merge 
            conflicts"

- So, GIT developed out of Linus Torvald's annoyance with centralized 
version-control system; he decided to modify this version-control model to use 
a DISTRIBUTED model
    - With Git, you can push changes to a LOCAL, no-internet-required 
    repository by "cloning" the whole online repository to your local machine, 
    and enjoy local version control; THEN, you can push from your local 
    repository to the online "master" repository!

- To create a new LOCAL repo with Git (after you've downloaded it, set up 
paths, etc.), you navigate to the folder you want to make a repo (in the 
command line) and say "git init"
    - This will create a ".git" file that keeps track of your changes
- To add files from the folder to the list of "tracked" files in your repo, 
type "git add &lt;filename(s)&gt;"
    - You need to do this after EVERY TIME you update the file; if you want to 
    add ALL changed files, you use "git add *"
- "git status" will tell you if there are any files that have changed / aren't 
being tracked / etc.
- Then, you say "git commit" to "stage" those changes
    - Git will then prompt you for a "commit message" describing your changes; 
    you can type "git commit -m '...' " as a shortcut for this
        - PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE write decent messages that actually describe 
        what you did
    - This JUST commits changes to your LOCAL repo
- NOTE: If you want to see the list of all previous commits, you can use the 
"git log" command 

- Now, to "clone" an existing GitHub repository, you use "git clone &lt;online 
repo url&gt;"
    - You can get the url by hitting the "clone" button on GitHub's website
    - This will bring in all the files from that online repository onto your 
    repo
- So, after you've made your changes, and are ready to push them online, say 
"git push origin master"
    - The branch can be named anything, and the "origin" name can be changed
    - WARNING: If you go on "GitHub", there's a "pencil" icon that lets you 
    edit the file DIRECTLY on the master repository. DO NOT USE THIS. IT WILL 
    LEAD TO CRAZY, WILD, STUPID MERGE CONFLICTS. If you need to edit something 
    REALLY unimportant, like the readme file, that's okay; but do NOT edit code 
    files except through the actual "add/commit/push" process
