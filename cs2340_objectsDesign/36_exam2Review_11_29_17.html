//******************* Exam 2 Review - November 29th, 2017 *******************//
//**************************************************************************//

- So, let's go over a few things for Exam 2 coming up this Friday! We'll just 
go through some of the previous practice tests and address the things you 
should know about these questions
    - First, a quick topic list to remind you what's on this test (keep in mind 
    that this is intentionally a bit broad, so study to get the details!):
        - UML Class Diagrams
        - Sequence Diagrams
        - Contracts and Error Handling
        - GRASP principles / Object Design
        - Coding Standards/Reviews
        - Unit Testing
        - UI Design / Evaluation
        - Packaging Principles and Design Metrics
        - Design Patterns
    - "I will NOT ask programming questions about Android, although I might ask 
    some conceptual questions about what we've done (e.g. persistence)"

- Starting with the Spring 2014 Exam 1:
    - For UML, know + is public, - is private, # is protected, static variables 
    are underlined, {readonly} for constant variables, what the different 
    arrows/arrowheads mean, how to write methods/classes, etc.
        - "I might give you the UML diagram and ask you to write the Java code 
        outline for it, or give you the Java code and ask what the UML diagram 
        should look like, or tell you what the UML diagram needs to represent 
        ('A Chest object contains 0 to 4 Items, where Items is an abstract 
        class; the Chest knows what items it contains, but Item doesn't know 
        what Chest it's in...') and ask you to sketch it"
    - We did NOT cover MVP (Model-View-Presenter), architectural styles, etc., 
    so I won't ask you questions on that stuff

- From the Fall 2014 Exam 2 test:
    - Know ALL the GRASP principles
        - e.g. That they don't apply to OOA, since they're about designing our 
        code instead of doing any domain analysis
    - Know Law of Demeter, and that it minimizes coupling by only letting us 
    talk to "nearby" classes
    - Switch statements are generally bad since they violate open-closed 
    principle, and we could use Polymorphism/Indirection instead
    - Know all of the design patterns that we DID cover, and some of their 
    advantages and disadvantages; be able to describe each of the patterns and 
    when you would use them
        - e.g. Singleton has the advantage of letting us have global access to 
        a model, but the disadvantage is that it makes our programs highly 
        coupled to that class
        - Strategy is good for when we have classes that all do similar things 
        with only slight behavior differences, etc.
        - We did NOT cover Flyweight pattern this semester, so ignore those 
        questions
    - UI stuff! Know what we went over in class and the different evaluation 
    techniques (Think-Aloud vs Heuristic vs Cognitive Walkthroughs): natural 
    mappings, mental models (how the User thinks your system works), 
    recognition vs recall (recognition is more user-friendly), 
    affordances/false affordances, etc.
    - Testing: know what we went over in class! Remember equivalence partitions 
    AND boundary conditions (when a method needs a certain range of stuff to 
    test, we test the end points, value inside the set, and value outside the 
    set)
        - e.g. Triangle question on this test was looking for 4 sets of values, 
        since there were 4 partitions (scalene, equilateral, isoceles, and 
        invalid triangle)
        - Also know whitebox vs blackbox testing, statement vs branch coverage
            - REMEMBER: Branch coverage has to cover EVERY possible prediacte 
            condition
                - e.g. "if (x&gt;50 &amp;&amp; x&lt;60)", then to achieve branch coverage, we 
                need 1 case where both x&gt;50, 1 case where x&lt;50, 1 case where 
                x&gt;60, and 1 case where x&lt;60

- From the "Exam2CS2340" practice test:
    - Know the SOLID principles 
        - B is "Violates SRP", C is "Violate LSP" (since we have to use 
        instanceof to check functionality, which we should NOT have to do)
    - Know about coupling and cohesion; we ALWAYS want high cohesion and low 
    coupling
    - Remember the code review stuff we went over!
        - E should be "e" (both C and D would be valid ways of solving the 
        problem)
    - Remember the basics of dependency injection / dependency inversion
    - Can combat "morning-after syndrome" by following the Acyclic Dependency 
    Principle (keeping packages stable, then basing development off of stable 
    package version)
- For the macro question on this test:
    - Command pattern let's us pool multiple commands, so we can create macros 
    using that pattern 
    - A is also valid, so "D" would be the right answer
- Singleton question is both B and C: Singleton pattern limits design reuse due 
to coupling 
- Testing questions: 
    - To achieve statement coverage, we need case where X &lt; 0, case where Y &lt; 
    0, case where x &gt; 30 &amp;&amp; 0 &lt; y &lt; 7, and a case where none of those cases are 
    met so we reach the "return true" statement (i.e. x &gt; 0, y &gt; 0, AND 0 &lt; x &lt; 
    30 OR 7 &gt; y); therefore, the correct answer is D
    - For branch coverage, you need to add the "x = 30, y = 7" case as well 
    (answer B)
        - "REMEMBER: Branch coverage means every PREDICATE in a statement has 
        to have a true/false case (e.g. if we have "a &amp;&amp; b || c", we need cases 
        where a is false/true, b is false/true, and c is false/true), but we do 
        NOT have to test every possible combination of true/false in that 
        statement"
- For equivalence partiton, answer is B (-45, 18, 3432)
- For boundary conditions, the answer is C (-1, 0, 1000, 1001)

- Besides all of this, you should know what we went over in-class about 
exceptions/error-handling, packages, sequence diagrams, etc.; anything that 
came up in-class since the first exam is fair game. Just like on Exam 1, you're 
all allowed a 1-page cheat sheet, front and back; good luck!
