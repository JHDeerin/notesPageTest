//******* Intro to Programming Paradigms/OOP - September 15th, 2017 *********//
//**************************************************************************//

- So, for 1st exam: we're a bit behind
- I usually DON'T ask coding questions, but higher-level stuff; anyway, let's 
get back to Android
--------------------------------------------

- RECYCLER VIEWS are like a high-tech version of the old "List" view
    - Basically, every time you scroll down, to show a new item in the list, 
    it'll "recycle" the top-level container and put it on the bottom to display 
    the new item
        - Think scrolling in Scratch, which was done w/ just 2 sprites that 
        swapped places
        - This is MUCH more performant than the old list, where it would just 
        create a new box/element for EACH item in the list, which was NOT good 
        if you had a very large list
            - You'll eventually need to use these for your project, to allow 
            Rat sighting reports
            - You might also want to use this for the current M3 milestone
    - Again "Layout" for each of these views is stored in "Layout" XML files...
        -...Android is one of those things where you learn by doing, so if this 
        is confusing, look at some of the resources and tutorials online, and 
        then dive in and start building stuff to get a feel for what I'm 
        talking about
    - "NullPointerExceptions when you're trying to find the view by its ID are 
    almost always due to spelling errors"

- In Android, there's a thing called the "ViewHolder", and a thing called an 
"Adapter" that maps between our POJO models and Android's views
    - ViewHolder is more-or-less just an internal class used by the adapter
    - "ViewHolder" BINDS the view of the model to the model's POJO class 
    itself, so if the view updates, then the model's data ALSO updates, and if 
    the model updates, then the view ALSO updates
        - You'll do this for CourseActivity, and possibly also 
        CourseDetailActivity

- For the homework, you don't have to worry about multiple layouts; just worry 
about 1
- (again, example code is on T-Square)
    - "M3 is due on Monday, so just upload your whole Lab3 directory as a .zip 
    file on T-Square"
    - We'll revisit Android programming when we get to importing Rat Data to 
    our application

- So, for now, let's get into some design stuff
- First up: Object Theory!
    - "Timothy Budd's book's first 4 chapters are all about the CONCEPT of OOP 
    design, so that'd be cool to read"
        - OTHER DESIGN PARADIGMS: 
            - Procedural(C, Fortran, Cobol)
                - Thinking in "verbs"; "What does my program have to DO?", 
                divide program into series of functions and data stored in 
                static data structures
                - "Plenty of people use Java or C++ like this; their "objects" 
                are really just containers for data, and all the heavy lifting 
                is done by functions outside of the objects"

            - Object-Oriented (C++, Java, Smalltalk)
                - "We ask WHO's doing the work, and break the program into a 
                bunch of objects w/ different tasks"

            - Functional (Scheme, OCAML, F#, fp, Scala)
                - Mostly academic, but has been gradually creeping into 
                industry through Scala, parts of React.js in the Web-dev world, 
                etc.
                    - "Our CS 1 class used to be taught in Scheme, which was 
                    universally hated by students since...well...functional 
                    programming isn't how we usually think about things, 
                    although it is really cool once you understand it"
                - "This is like the reverse of 'functional decomposition' in 
                procedural programming; we start with the little details, and 
                then build them up into a whole"
                - 

            - Logic (Prolog)
                - Programming based around logical rules; really interesting 
                theoretically, but not really used outside of research
        - So, in this class, we'll just focus on OOP; but be aware that it 
        isn't the be-all end-all of programming paradigms; there ARE other ways 
        of doing this

- So, WHY do we want to use OOP?
    - Helps w/ understanding large programs via abstraction of detail
        - "When we think of a car, we don't think of it in terms of individual 
        wheels, pistons, screws, bolts; we think of it as something to get us 
        from one place to the next"
    - Helps organize large systems into different modules
        - Some debate in the theoretical CS world if objects are the BEST way 
        to do this, but by-and-large OOP has helped keep large systems organized
    - Enables a better way to reuse software via creating "Software ICs"
        -...this one has been more of a failure. The HOPE was we could avoid 
        writing low-level code by finding the single-most efficient way of 
        doing general tasks, so we were free to only focus on the high-level 
        problems of software. This has kinda worked for VERY fundamental tasks 
        (Math libraries, etc.), but seems to break down for anything more 
        complicated.

- So, let's say we're designing a flower shop, with a "flower" object and a 
"bouquet" object:
    Flower {
        char species;
        int price;
    }

    Bouquet {
        Flowers[];
        Vase;
    }

    - Now, we start thinking of what we have to do: we need a method for adding 
    flowers to boquets, sending flowers to customers, collecting money, growing 
    the plants...
        - This is NOT Object-oriented design; this is PROCEDURAL design, done 
        in an object-oriented language!
        - "That code'll be pretty strictly tied to selling flowers; porting it 
        over to another use would require a LOT of redesigning"

    - An OOP way of designing the program would we more based around NOUNS
        - So, for the Flower Shop, we'll need our Flower/Bouquet classes
        - THEN, we need a class for the Florist w/ the role of trimming the 
        flowers, for the Grower who creates the flowers, for the Arranger who 
        makes the boquets, for the CFO who plans the finances, for the Cashier 
        who's at the register, etc...
            - This is more flexible; by creating the COMPONENTS of a 
            flower-shop, and all the objects within it, we can easily do 
            deifferent things with those objects if we've designed them well!

- The BIGGEST problem I see with students new to OOP is that they make a TON of 
instance variables / static methods. This isn't OOP; this is a C program in 
disguise!
    - In OOP, the work is done in instance methods on the appropriate class; 
    good objects have clear, cohesive, focused roles and clear interfaces for 
    interacting with it
- So, what is an "object", anyway?
    - An OBJECT is a class that can do 4 things:
        - Holds/"knows" information
        - Performs services
        - Interacts w/ other objects (or at least allows it)
        - Makes decisions
    - Good objects have an "Identity" (they do ONE specific thing), they're 
    ENCAPSULATED ("They hide the details of how they do things"), and they 
    enable Polymorphism ("We can all do that thing, but I can do it MY way")

- On MONDAY, a speaker from Google is coming to talk about their software dev 
process; after that, we have our test on the 27th, so we'll need to get ready 
for that!
