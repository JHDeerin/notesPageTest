//************** Intro to Design Principles - October 25th, 2017 ************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Last time, we talked a little bit about security w/ SQL injection; now, we're 
watching a YouTube video called "SQL Injection - Walking through Walls"
    - Basically, year after year, SQL injection is STILL the #1 vulnerability 
    in software. The lesson - ALL USER INPUT IS SUSPECT (and do NOT rely on JS 
    validation, since malicious users can edit the Javascript on the page to 
    get around it)!
    - "...and that's about as far as we go with security in this class. It's an 
    important design topic, but as crucial as it is, it simply isn't a focus of 
    this course"

- So, we know a LOT of mechanical stuff - HOW to draw a class diagram, UML 
diagrams, etc., but how do we actually know if we have a GOOD design? What are 
some design principles we can use to not just explain our design, but make it 
better?
    - "Annoyingly for you guys, design is an 'ill-structured problem'; there's 
    no one right answer, no silver bullet, what works well in one case doesn't 
    work well in another, and so on. What'll follow are PRINCIPLES - they're 
    guidelines for design that people have found to work well, but they are NOT 
    the only good way of doing something. If breaking the rules makes sense for 
    your app, and you know why you're breaking the rules - go for it!"

- COUPLING - we want to have as LOW coupling as possible, so that making a 
change in 1 class won't interfere with another class unnecessarily
- Some common kinds of coupling, from worst to best (well, least bad):
    - Worst kind: CONTENT coupling, where 1 class modifies another
        - NEVER DO THIS (fortunately, Java makes it really hard to pull this 
        off anyway; "Assembly programmers, resist the temptation")
    - COMMON coupling - the classes/components share common (i.e. global) data
        - "This is why some people HATE singletons, because if everything is 
        relying on the singleton, then it makes it hard to pull a component out 
        of your app and reuse it in something else, since it's dependent on 
        that global data"
        - Try REALLY hard not to do this unless there's literally no alternative
    - CONTROL coupling - Use a return code to control a different method
        - e.g. "If statusCode = 1, sortAscending, else sortDescending"
    - Stamp/data - passes complex data or structures between modules
        - This is stuff like passing data w/ JSON, etc.; this is the most 
        common type of coupling, and is usually perfectly fine
    - Best: Uncoupled, classes have no relationship!

- COHESION - we want each component to have as MUCH cohesion as possible
- From worst (least cohesive) to best:
    - Coincidental - the class is just a lot of unrelated functions
    - Logical - kind of like control coupling, the methods are kind of related 
    by what they do (e.g. all the sorting methods go in one class, even if they 
    don't sort the same kind of data, etc.) 
    - Temporal - connected to different phases of an operation; "all of these 
    are in the class since they happen at the same time, even if they aren't 
    really related"
    - Procedural - required ordering of tasks (???)
    - Communicational - all of the methods operate on the same data set (e.g. 
    all of the methods do some operation on our CSV file)
    - Functional - The class/method has only ONE overriding responsibility 
    (e.g. creating a new rat report), and EVERYTHING that component does is 
    essential for doing that operation
- "A REALLY good article on this topic: 
enterprisecraftsmanship.com/2015/09/02/cohesion-coupling-difference"

- So, we want our applications to be Low Copuling, High Cohesion, Low 
Representational Gap (LRG), and have Separation of Concerns
    - Low Representational Gap basically means that our code does what it 
    appears to do - it's easy to understand (DOUBLE CHECK THIS)

- Things we want to AVOID in our app:
    - High coupling
    - Low Cohesion
    - Rigidity
        - "Bob, we like the rat application, but we want to add a new 
        report...oh, that requires me to modify this-this-and-that class..."
        - Basically, RIGID code means it's hard to make changes to the 
        application without rewriting siginificant parts of your application
    - Fragility
        - "I changed this one class, and now these 3 other features broke..."
        - FRAGILE means that changes in one part of the code can easily cause 
        new problems to appear
    - Immobility
        - 
    - Hackability / Viscocity
        - "This isn't really the right way to do it, but the right way's hard 
        to do, so I'll just do this one little hack..."
        - If your code is made up of a bunch of hacks, it'll get hard to 
        maintain real quick
    - Needless Complexity (YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It)
        - "Wow, the customer might want to search for rats by Facebook User, or 
        Google plus groups, so I should add those hooks..."
        - Basically, if you don't KNOW you need it, and there's not a high 
        likelihood you will, don't worry about it
    - Needless Repetition (DRY)
    - Opacity (obscurse, obtuse, hard to understand, etc.)
        - "When people learn C, I know they like to impress their friends with 
        how short they can write their methods...yeah, the maintenance guys 
        don't appeciate that"
        - "A good motto: CLEAR code is better than CLEVER code"

- We talked about RDD; it's a good thing to keep in mind
- Now, let's talk about GRASP (General Reposibility Assignment Software 
Patterns)
    - "These are NOT patterns that people will ask you about in technical 
    interviews, like they would with, say, SOLID principles...instead, they're 
    an elaboration of some more general design principles that are good to keep 
    in mind"
    - There are 9 of them:
        - CREATOR PRINCIPLE
            - Who's reponsible for creating a new instance of the class? 
            - Well, some general rules - Class B should create class A if:
                - B contains or aggregates A
                - B records A
                - B closely uses A
                - B already has the data required to make A
            - If more than one option applies, prefer aggregation! (e.g. a 
            manager class that contains our class as a component)
                - Examples: Who makes a Square in a Checkers game (a: board)? 
                Who makes a RightSightingReport in our app (a: the 
                CreateRatReport activity, some separate ReportManager class...a 
                couple good options)? Who makes an Assignment object in 
                T-Square? Who creates a treasure chest item in an adventure 
                game?
        - INFORMATION EXPERT PRINCIPLE
        - LOW COUPLING
        - CONTROLLER
        - HIGH COHESION
        - POLYMORPHISM
        - PURE FABRICATION
        - INDIRECTION
        - PROTECTED VARIANTS
