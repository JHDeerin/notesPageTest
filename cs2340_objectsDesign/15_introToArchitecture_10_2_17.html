//************ Intro to Software Architecture - October 2nd, 2017 ***********//
//**************************************************************************//

- So, we've finished our OOA stage, and we understand WHAT the customer wants 
us to build; NOW, we have to start thinking about HOW we're going to implement 
this on a computer

- Now, a SYSTEM is an integrated composite of:
    - People
    - Products (both software AND hardware)
    - Processes
- ...to satisfy a stated objective
    - "System engineers, like ISYE majors, care a LOT about the big-picture 
    stuff like this."

- "So, since I'm from the military, I like to give practical examples. Let's 
think about a UFO Defence System."
    - The hardware people will be building the aircraft and submarines, the 
    ISYEs are organizing the logistic reponse systems, the EE majors are wiring 
    up the electronic alert systems, and us CS people are just writing the code 
    to manage our small part of the system
        - "Usually, the picture of the system is bigger than just us"

- This is known as the "System Architecture": how the overall system with ALL 
of its parts are organized. In the CS world, OUR small part of this is SOFTWARE 
ARCHITECTURE
    - "Software architecture for a program or computing system consists of the 
    structure(s) of that system, which comprise elements, the externally 
    visible properties of those elements, and the relationship between them"
    - "Good software architecture..."

- Now, for Architectural VIEWS - a VIEW is a representation of a set of system 
elements, and the relationships between them. Views are representations of the 
many system structures present at once in software systems
    - A few "standard views":
        - Conceptual/logical/functional
            - Easiest to think about; laying out a big-picture idea of what 
            each part of a system should DO, e.g. in MVC, we would have 3 
            boxes, 1 for each "responsibility". 
                - "This is the only one we're having you do for homework in 
                this class."
                - "When you're listing your components, don't use 'developer 
                speak', like front-end vs back-end; be general, e.g. 'UI'"
        - Process/runtime
            - This architecture is where every "box" in our diagram represents 
            a different process/thread that we're planning to run; "Used when 
            we're concerned with performance, or when we're dealing with 
            parallel applications and we have to figure out how different 
            threads will talk to each other."
        - Physical
            - We represent every physical device we're running the software on, 
            or having the software interact with, and the connections between 
            them.
                - "Not too important in this class since, well, we're ONLY 
                really using our phone; but at other times, if we have to 
                figure out how we're coordinating all of these physical 
                devices, it can be important to think about this."
        - Module/implementation
            - Either 1) How the codebase is going to be layed out, like a 
            folder system ("/linux is the root folder, with /kernel /doc 
            /device subfolders..."), OR 2) Showing how the software will 
            integrate with other 3rd-party products, like APIs. 
        - User interaction/Use case
        - Security
        - Performance

- So, the views are helpful, but they're certainly not everything. Another big 
part are architectural STYLES    
    - "Fortunately, you are NOT the first people to develop software like this, 
    and there are a LOT of existing architctural styles that have been devised 
    to help manage software projects"
    - Some common ones:
        - Client-Server
            - "A bunch of clients are connected to a central server"
            - "Thin" variants mean that most of the processing is done on the 
            server, and the client just sees the view (e.g. T-square, most 
            internet sites that aren't super JS heavy)
            - "Fat" client variants mean that most of the processing is done by 
            the CLIENT (e.g. downloading software on your phone) 
                - A disadvantage of this system: what happens if the server's 
                down? You can't use the app then!
                - "Fat clients have less of a problem with this, but it still 
                is an issue"
        - Peer-to-peer
            - EVERYONE is considered an equal, and connected to one another; if 
            we're playing a game, then EVERYONE has all of the game state 
            information, and if someone drops out, then the game doesn't break 
            like it would if a server broke!
                - The problem here is that we need to make sure users can 
                connect to each other, "discover" each other, etc., which can 
                be pretty darn complicated
        - Blackboard/Shared Memory
            - Used alot in AI applications; basically, we have a central "data 
            store" where all of our data is, and then we have a bunch of 
            smaller "knowledge stores" that can each solve a small part of the 
            problem, then put it back in the data store (e.g. in a cryptography 
            breaker, KS1 might do pattern-recognition, KS2 might find the 
            letter E, KSN might try to combine all the letters, etc.)
                - A problem with this is that we have to check when information 
                updates
        - Pipe &amp; Filter
            - "This is the way we did it in the punchcard days"; One part of 
            the app does the 1st part of the task, then passes the data along 
            to the 2nd part of the app, which does its part, then passes it to 
            the 3rd part...and if we want to change the process, we add a new 
            step in-between 2 things
                - "Linux's PIPE syntax in BASH is inspired by this"
                - Another example: image processing! We layer these image 
                filters on top of one another
        - MVC
            - We've already beat this to death; we'll look at variants of this 
            down the road
        - n-tier
            - We have a set number of tiers, each with a set focus; e.g., we 
            have a "data tier", "data access tier", "business tier", etc.
        - Layered
            - Similar to n-tier, but tiers are less separated (might have to 
            look this up again)
        - Event-driven/Implicit Invocation
            - We put in an event like "Rat sighted" w/ its data, and then the 
            relevant objects for that event use the data, while the 
            non-relevant objects ignore the data. "So instead of having a bunch 
            of separate methods, we instead broadcast an 'event' to every 
            object, and each object then handles its own repsonsibilities for 
            those events"
            - "Again, this is a big deal in modeling &amp; simulation applications; 
            HLA is a good example, which the Mod &amp; Sim people will probably 
            learn about later on"
                - Great for keeping things VERY decoupled
