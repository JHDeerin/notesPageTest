//*********** Scheduling and Multiprogramming - June 12th, 2018 *************//
//**************************************************************************//

- So, pipeline-wise, other people are halfway done, have finished X and Y and 
Z...sooooooo yeah, I should probably start on that soon
- Meanwhile, a solid 1/3 of the class is here on an overcast day, at 10:08, and 
we're just about to get started with our dive into Chapter 6
------------------------------------------------------------

- So, up until now, we've been focused on the underlying architecture of the 
machine and getting our processor running. But what does the processor have to 
actually DO?
    - In this lecture, we'll be jumping up to the next step of abstraction for 
    this class, and talking about how the processor actually starts to run and 
    manage user programs

- Looking through the processes on your systems, what do you see?
    - Remember, a program is the code containing the instructions for a 
    program, and a process is the portion(s) of code that's actually running at 
    a given time
        - So, a process needs space in memory to hold its instructions and 
        dynamic data, runs when the PC points to it (CPU time), and possibly 
        access to I/O (like the hard drive) or the network

- Let's say that you have a list of things you need to do for the day (get 
groceries, call mom, make dinner, do homework); how do you decide when to do 
what?
    - In a computer, we have a similar problem: we've got 2 or more programs 
    that both need to run at the same time, so how do we decide when each one 
    gets to run?
    - Well, that's a job for the operating system!
        - Specifically, it's a job for the SCHEDULER, which keeps track of the 
        processes for the different resources; within a process, we can also 
        have THREADS that execute at different times
    - So, the big questions: how do we switch from running one job to another?
        - This brings in the idea of CONTEXT SWITCHING: moving all the state 
        information we need for the current process to its PCB (Process Control 
        Block), and moving the new process' state information from its PCB to 
        the registers, PC, etc.
            - Honestly, this isn't too different from calling functions, where 
            we put the state information we need to save on the stack before 
            switching control to the callee
                - The difference, of course, is that for processes we don't 
                just "forget" the callee after we're done running it; we have 
                to save ALL the processes' states before we switch!
                - In UNIX-based systems, processes keep track of their "process 
                ID" (PID) and their "parent" processes (PPID)
                    - This is commonly done using a "fork and exec" process: 
                    the "fork" command makes a duplicate process (the only 
                    difference is the new one has a different process ID, and 
                    will start on the line AFTER the fork was created), and the 
                    "execvp" command runs the given program
                        - Usually, an ID check is done to check if the program 
                        is the parent/child; if it's the child, it will execute 
                        the child program instead
                        - This is commonly done because it's simple (you just 
                        copy the process and rewrite what you need inside it), 
                        but it is kinda "heavyweight" (uses memory we might not 
                        need, etc.); we'll address this with threads later on
        - We have to switch between contexts fast enough to convince people 
        that all their programs are running at the same time, so predictably 
        enough, this whole process usually takes under a microsecond on modern 
        hardware
    - To decide WHEN to switch processess, the OS can be "NON-PREEMPTIVE" 
    (waits until the current process says it's okay to switch) or "PREEMPTIVE" 
    (will "cut off" programs early if they've been running for too long)
        - In Non-Preemptive systems, the process has the duty of saving all its 
        state; in Preemptive systems, since the OS is possibly cutting the 
        program off early, it has to save the process' state and usually has to 
        save EVERYTHING (since it can't be sure what the process really needs)

- So, what information actually needs to be in a process' PCB?
    - We need a process #, so we know what the processes ID is
    - The current PC value/Stack Pointer
    - General register values (NOT internal registers like the MAR)
    - Scheduling info
    - Memory limits ("processes don't get to use the whole memory, but just 
    what they've been allocated")
    - I/O status (is it waiting for a disk read, keystroke, etc.)
    - Accounting info (ports used)
    - Process state (any custom state info it needs)
    - A pointer to the next process
        - "Pointers save TONS of time compared to trying to manipulate 
        everything in memory"
- In C, this might literally take the form of a struct like this:

        enum state_type {new, ready, running, waiting, halted};

        typedef struct control_block_type {
            struct control_block *next_pcb;
            enum state_type currentState;
            address pc;                     // where to resume
            int reg_file[NUMREGS];          // contents of registers

            int priority;
            address address_space;          // location in memory
        } control_block;

- Now, the basic steps we need for a scheduler are:
    1) 
    2)
    3)
    4)
    - Now, for handling processes we usually think of just the "short-term 
    scheduler;" but there are a few different kinds of scheduler as well:
        - Long-term schedulers 
        - Medium-term schedulers are
    - So, how do we pick which process should be run next?
        - We know one of the big bottlenecks of our architecture is accessing 
        memory, and ESPECIALLY reading from the the disk or waiting for I/O
        - So, if a process has to wait for I/O or another event, we put it in 
        the "waiting" state until that operation has been completed; if it's 
        "just" been interrupted, we'll just put it back in the ready queue
    - So, we'll initially put processes in the "Ready" queue, run them, and 
    then depending on what they're doing will do one of a few things:
        - If it wants to make an I/O request, it will put it on the I/O request 
        queue
            - Then, when it's made the I/O request, we'll put it in a separate 
            I/O queue (since we want to let the processes make I/O requests and 
            not wait for them to complete)
        - If it ran for too long, then we'll stop it running and put it back on 
        the ready queue to let another process have a turn
        - If it's creating a child process, put it to the side to do that
        - 

- Great! We've got our shiny, working multiprogramming OS - how do we measure 
how "good" our system is?
    - Well, there are a few metrics we can use; most of them boil down to the 
    question, "how long did our processes spend just waiting?":
        - CPU Utilization: Percent of time the processor is budy doing something
        - Throughput: How many o
        - Average Turnaround Time: Average time between jobs entering/leaving 
        the system
        - Average Waiting Time
        - Response Time
    - Aside from these "quantitative" measures, we also have two qualitative 
    issues:
        - STARVATION is where your scheduling algorithm prevents a process from 
        ever completing
        - The CONVOY EFFECT is where the scheduling algorithm allows 
        long-running jobs to dominate the CPU and significantly delay smaller 
        processes (it's like waiting for a parade to pass to cross the street)

- So, what're some scheduling algorithms we can use to maximize our performance 
and minimize these issues? We'll look at 3 different ways (First-Come 
First-Served, Round-Robin, and Shortest Job First), each with different 
tradeoffs - but that'll be next time
