//************************ Paging - June 21st, 2018 *************************//
//**************************************************************************//

- The students numbers in lecture continue to dwindle...
----------------------------------------------------------

- Alright, so we were talking about memory management and, specifically, paging!
    - We talked about cutting up the memory into static partitions, but that's 
    pretty inflexible and leads to wasted space due to memory fragmentation
    - Dynamic memory is a little better, but it still has an issue with 
    external fragmentation (creating partitions too small to be used)
        - This can be controlled a little bit with compaction (combining free 
        memory chunks into one), but, as it turns out, compaction is an 
        expensive and time-intensive process
    - So, we settled on a kind of virtual memory called PAGING as the way to 
    go: it gives us flexibility, we can have more addresses from a programmer's 
    perspective than the physical memory, etc.
- Today, hopefully, we'll dive a bit deeper into the details of how paging 
actually works

- Alright, so last class we looked at the basic ideas of paging: splitting up 
the "logical memory" into different, equal-sized chunks called "pages," and 
mapping those pages onto physical "frames" in the actual memory
    - Now, because we have to get the frame # from our page, we have to make 
    TWO trips to memory: 1 to get the physical address for our virtual address, 
    the 2nd to actually get the data
        - That seems *really* slow, but there are things we can do to keep this 
        reasonable - even fast!
    - Also, remember the purpose of the valid bit in the page table: if it's 0, 
    it means that our process isn't using that frame yet, so we have to try and 
    fetch it from memory
        - This is referred to as a PAGE FAULT, and all it means is "you, 
        Mr./Mrs./[REDACTED] Process, don't have that page in memory; you've 
        gotta fetch it from the disk"
            - Usually, this happens because another process was using this 
            frame; we have a separate data structure (the frame table) that 
            tells us which process is using the frame
        - While we handle this, we've gotta stall the pipeline so that it 
        doesn't try to run new instructions while we're setting this frame up
    - If the bit is valid (i.e. 1) after we do our first memory check, on the 
    other hand, we can just go ahead to the physical frame the page table says 
    and do whatever we need!

- Alright, let's go through the worksheet I handed out last time - let's walk 
through some stuff we need to do for paging by hand!
    - For simplicity, we'll assume only 1 page is moving at the same time
    - Doing this, some things I noted:
        - Just getting the next instruction is pretty simple
        - Instructions that deal with memory (like "store" or something) have 
        to run their addresses through the paging process AGAIN - if the frame 
        is invalid, well, we have to pick an available frame (preferably NOT 
        one containing our instructions), put that frame # in our page table 
        (at the page entry we were trying to access originally, i.e. the one 
        with the invalid bit), and then update the "valid" bit to be 1
            - After all that, we then basically run the instruction AGAIN 
            (starting the pipeline over), and, now that the bit is valid, we 
            can just write the value into the frame
            - Side note: The page # is usually calculated as physical address / 
            frame size (integer division, e.g. )
                - ...the free frames are kept track of in a linked list, called 
                the "free list"
            - We do the SAME THING when fetching instructions, if we need to 
            allocate a new frame and put instructions in memory (instructions 
            gotten from the disk, I believe?)
        - We rely on the OS to set the page table register (PTBR)

- Now, what if during a page fault we're looking for the next free frame, and 
we make a SHOCKING DISCOVERY: there are no more free frames available! We're 
using all of them!
    - In this case, we'll have to take (*dun dun dun*)...DESPERATE measures 
    (*thunder and cackling in the background*)
    - Basically, we'll have to find an active frame that we can evict
- Before we get to that, though, let's talk about DEMAND PAGING
    - In this scheme, we ONLY load a page when an instruction needs it; 
    otherwise, we'd be trying to load a lot of empty pages that we don't need 
    yet
    - Do we need to add any hardware to support this? Well, we need to add a 
    small amount of stuff to check for page faults, but other than that, it's 
    just the regular paging hardware!
        - When a page fault occurs, if we have to update the valid bit for our 
        process, then we need to add a data structure called the FRAME TABLE 
        that, for each frame in memory, will keep track of which process is 
        using it, and where its page table entry is - this way, we can update 
        that process's page table so it knows we took that frame from it
- When EVICTING a page, though, we need to do a few things:
    - First off, there are 2 statuses the page could be in:
        - A CLEAN page has not been written to yet, and thus matches its 
        counterpart on the disk
        - A DIRTY page has been written to and no longer matches what's stored 
        on the disk for it
    - So, we can "simply" evict clean pages without penalty, but dirty pages 
    have to be stored back onto the disk!
    - Now, if we're just reading from the frame, that's fine, we don't have to 
    change anything - but if we're planning on overwriting anything, well, 
    we've gotta mark it as dirty

- More conceptually, what's actually the performance of demand paging?
    - Now, let's say that "p" is the probability of a page fault, accessing 
    normal memory takes 100ns, and accessing the disk takes 25,000,000 ns
        - That means that, if p is only 0.1%, our access time compared to just 
        normal memory is 250 times slower than normal - OUCH!
    - Luckily, there are ways for us to speed this up and enjoy the sweet, 
    sweet flexibility of paging without destroying our processing speed - ways 
    that we'll start looking at next week
        - As a quick overview, though, here are some of the thing we can do:
            - Take advantage of the fact we usually access from the same page 
            multiple times in a row
            - Optimize our choice of page size, etc.
            - Add some hardware like "translation look-aside buffers", caches, 
            etc.

- ...but until then, study for your test next week and enjoy the weekend! 
Caching will NOT be on the exam, but paging will!
