//*********** Processor Basics / Calling Stack - May 17th, 2018 *************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Slowly learning the best routes to the Mason building from West...slowly.
    - They mostly seem to involve parking lots. Unfortunately.
--------------------------------------------------------------

- Alright, let's get right back into it!
    - Today, we'll be talking about processors, BUT FIRST...some syllabus things
        - Office hours will be slightly updated; again, if none of them work for you, feel free to reach out to me or the TAs to arrange a meeting
        - The late policy of "one assignment can be late by 3 days" will stand
            - "It's like a ticket; you can't chop it up into 3 one-time tickets"
            - I understand that you've got other classes, and sometimes things get tight; that's why we have this one-time "get out of jail free" card, but we don't want to encourage a habit of turning things in late
        - There's a 2-hour lecture, then a 2-hour recitation; we'll try to keep them in sync. The basic philosophy is:
            - Lectures cover concepts from the textbook, first at a high level, then going through the details
            - Recitation/Lab will take those concepts, cover the confusing parts, and translate them into hands-on "what do I need to know to make this work?"

- So, last time/in recitation, we covered a few things:
    - There's a "layer cake" of how computers work from most abstract to least abstract: 
        - Algorithms/High-Level Programs 
        - -&gt; Software (e.g. OS/compiler) 
        - -&gt; Computer Architecture (i.e. ISA) 
        - -&gt; Machine Organization (datapath/control) 
        - -&gt; Sequential/Combinational Logic elements (ALU, registers, PC, etc.) 
        - -&gt; Logic Gates 
        - -&gt; Transistors 
        - -&gt; Solid-State Physics 
    - Quick reminders:
        - COMBINATIONAL logic doesn't depend on prior states; given an input, we know what the output will be. SEQUENTIAL logic means that we remember what happened in prior operations, affecting the result
        - The OS acts a resource manager for programs, gives the "illusion" of a consistent interface to hardware operations, etc.
- In math, you don't start by teaching people about complex numbers, but by teaching them "1-2-3". The LC-3 was our "1-2-3" of processor design; now, in this class, we're going to start getting more realistic
- Quick overview of OS evolution:
    - In the 1960s, during the Apollo missions, we had mainframe computers
        - Nowadays, most laptops are ~2-3 GHz, 8-16 gb of RAM, etc; the Apollo guidance computer had 2 Khz and 38 Kb of RAM
            - "Nowadays, our SELFIES are 1 MB! The power of what even a few kilobytes of processing can do is ENORMOUS!"
            - Still, ABC: "Always Be Creative", always ask how can we do things better...that's what drives innovation
    - We then proceeded to PC/Desktops with GUIs, Enterprise OS software, etc.
- This course will teach us about Processor, Memory, I/O, Parallelism, and Networking

- So, what does the "hardware-software" stack look like for this class?
    - Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
        - We start here, because it's the dictionary of the "words" we know how to use to talk to the hardware (specifically, the processor)
        - We store these instructions on some sort of persistent storage, like a hard drive
    - When the computer starts, these instructions are loaded by the BIOS: the "Basic Input-Output System"
        - The BIOS usually first does a diagnostic check to make sure the computer hardware is A-okay and working
        - It THEN starts searching in a few places for the OS itself; when it finds it, it initalizes the OS, makes sure it's running, and then says good night and lets the OS take over
            - Where might the OS be found? A hard drive, a USB drive, a CD, on a network, a floppy disk (if you've been cursed)
            - There's a small "bootloader" component in each OS that handles booting, which is when you see the "startup" screen on your computer
                - How does the BIOS know where this bootloader is? There's apparently a convention so that it knows, but we won't get into that right now
    - So, once the OPERATING SYSTEM (OS) is loaded into memory, the computer has officially begun running
        - When the operating system is running, it'll run any machine code for applications that start up
        - When we have source code we write on the OS, though, that we want to run, we need compilers to turn it into machine code, or interpreters that do this in realtime, which is what makes the application work
- So, with that basic high-level stack gone through, let's reconvene in a few minutes; then, we'll go through some architecture stuff...
    - ...including *drumroll*...the datapath

========== 10 Minute Break ==========

- So, on the slides, there's another layer cake of how high-level languages "trickle down" to ISA instructions
    - Compilers turn the language into a set of "static" machine code that runs natively on the computer
    - Interpreters are programs that execute source code at run-time, line-by-line; because of this, compiled code is usually significantly faster, but takes longer to start up the first time
        - With "Just-In-Time" compilers (JTCs), interpreted languages are sometimes faster overall, and they tend to also be simpler to debug since they fail right at the actual line in the program; they also have the advantage of not having to re-compile the source code for each type of hardware (just the interpreter itself needs to be recompiled)
    - ...Java, with the JVM, is a weird hybrid of this
- So, the goals for writing a good ISA are to 1) Maximize performance 2) Easy to build compilers for 3) Easy to build hardware for 4) Minimize cost
    - ...these goals are usually in conflict; large instruction sets make building compilers easy (e.g. "don't have to manually program multiplication in assembly") but makes the hardware more complex and often less optimized, increasing performance usually increases cost and hardware complexity, etc.

- Operands: there's a choice to keep them just in memory, or in a combination of registers and memory. Basically ALL computers nowadays use registers
    - People ALWAYS want more registers, so guess what? In this class, the fake computer has more registers!
- For addressing: remember from 2110 the idea of "base + offset" addressing when dealing with memory
    - Remember the Apollo computer? It DIDN'T HAVE memory addresses explicitly, because of the memory constraints; they had to write SELF-MODIFYING CODE to get it to work! That's crazy!
- Compiling loops, if-statements, etc.; should be basically the same as 2110
- Compiling procedure calls: this is almost NECESSARY for sane high-level programming, but introduces a LOT of issues from an assembly, compilation perspective: how do we swap to a different place in code? How do we remember where we need to return to? How do we know when we need to go back? How do we save the state of each scope? What the HECK is going on with recursion (it's actually just a function call, so recursion isn't a special case, but it still freaks out students)?
    - Remember the stack from 2110? That's how we did it then, but there's a BUNCH of different ways to do this, and really all of them are a bit messy; we have to preserve the caller's state, pass in parameters, save the address we're returning to, transfer control to the called procedure, allocate space for the procedure's local variables, do what we need to do, pass back any returned values, and then go back to our old state
    - Most ISA's have a recommended way of doing this; for the 2200 architecture, we'll have a slightly new way of doing this, using our new bunch of registers to communicate between the caller/callee so that we don't have to go to memory as much
        - ...we still have to worry about the stack for deeply nested calls, large parameter lists, etc., though, and then handle returning the address (with a JAL, "jump-and-link" instruction) and transferring control
    - So, the software conventions we'll use:
        - Registers s0-s2 are the caller's registers (must be saved if overwritten), t0-t2 are temp, a0-a2 are parameter-passing registers, v0 is used for return value, ra has the return address, at is the target address, sp is the stack pointer
        - REMEMBER: Stack pointer points to the TOP of the stack, and the frame pointer points to the return address
            - The frame pointer is NOT necessary to do things, but it means we don't have to remember how many arguments/variables we're saving to find the return address
    - The steps we use for the stack WITHOUT the frame pointer (images on Chpt. 2 text slides):
        1) Save any registers you need as the caller
        2) Caller puts parameters in the registers
        3) Save return values (if needed)
        4) Save return address
        5) Jump to the callee
        6) Callee saves any registers it plans to use during execution on the stack
        7) Allocate space for any local variables
            - (...do work...)
        8) Put the return value in the return register
        9-12) (...breaking the stack down, missed the exact steps)
        - BASICALLY, the point is that if we're just doing a simple procedure call, we can just save our values in the registers and not deal with memory access slowing us down; we can use registers more and memory less on average
    - With the frame pointer, we say our "new" step 6 includes storing the old frame pointer on the stack and pointing the new frame pointer at it, so we always can get back to the old one

- Architectural styles: how can we organize the computer? We've been talking about "register-oriented" architectures (ARM is an example), but there are other ways of doing it
    - Stack-oriented architectures (calculators, JVM), since they don't depend on the number of registers, tend to be more portable
    - Memory-oriented architectures (IBM 360, older machines) used memory instead of registers since registers were still expensive back then; nowadays, this style has been mostly supplanted by register-oriented architectures for speed reasons
    - Hybrid schemes that try and combine some of the advantages of these schemes

- ...okay, so we didn't *quite* get to the datapath today, but we definitely will next week! Until then, see you later!
