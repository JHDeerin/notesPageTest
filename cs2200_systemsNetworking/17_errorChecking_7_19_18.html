//******************* Error Checking - July 19th, 2018 **********************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Once again, the stalwarts have arrived...and no one else
---------------------------------------------------------------

- Alright, today we'll finish talking about file system transactions (i.e. logging file changes before committing them), error correction codes ("keep your data safe when it's being stored!"...also important for networking), and some brief networking concepts
    - "We're only going to cover the basics of all of these, but I want to give you all a good overviw"

- So, in a modern system, we try to not actually spend that much time writing everything to disk (that'd slow us down); INSTEAD of writing those changes directly, we first have these "transaction records" we write that keep track of what's going on
    - e.g. "&lt;T3, X, 9, 1&gt;" means that transaction #3 is going to change the value of X from 9 to 1
        - Naturally, we'll have a whole bunch of these things
    - This way, if your system crashes, two things happen when we boot the system back up: 
        - If the transactions have a "commit" message for a certain transaction (e.g. &lt;T3 commit&gt;), then we REDO all those changes and write them back into the file
        - Otherwise, we UNDO all of that transaction's changes (since it crashed halfway through doing something) and change all the values in that file to the old values
            - The order we do this is usually UNDO first (start at the end of the log, check if there's a commit message for that transaction ID, otherwise undo it), then REDO by going back from the start to the end of the list

- Now, sad as it may be, disk storage systems aren't perfect - bits can get flipped by solar radiation, data can get corrupted, etc., so we try to deal with this via ERROR DETECTION
    - Let's say we know that for any given set of 3 bits (X, Y, Z), there's a chance that one of them might get changed - how can we deal with that?
        - Well, we can think of this as a set of 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z); if we start with data 000, there are 8 combinations of what could happen in the "cube" of potential X/Y/Z changes: (000, 010, 100, 001, 011, 110, 101, 111)

                011 ------- 111
                /|           /|
               / |          / |
             010 ------- 110  |
              | 001 ----- | -101
              | /         |  /
              |/          | /
             000 ------- 100 

            - However, only 1 bit can be flipped AT A TIME - so, if we envision the changes as going along 1 "edge" of this cube, if we choose values on opposite "corners" of the cube (000 vs 101, 010 vs 111), the # of 1s and 0s have changed from what we intended (CHECK THIS?)
                - So, if you know we meant to send either 000 or 101, and instead we get something that 
        - So, if you're sending 000, and instead I get 001, how do I know that an error had occurred?
            - Well, let's say that we ONLY are sending 000 or 111 - because only 1 bit can be flipped, that means that if a change occurs, the ones that changed from 000 will only have 1 "1" bit, while those changed from 111 will have only 1 "0" bit, so we know an error occurred - and not only that, we KNOW if it should've been 000 or 111!

- "So, that's nice, but if I told you you had to program everything in terms of 000 and 111 bit groups, you'd look at me like I was crazy - and rightfully so!"
    - So, what we more often do is use PARITY BITS - for a given chunk of data (e.g. a 5x5 "grid" of 25 bits), we could have 10 bits (1 for each row/column) and say that 1 means an even/odd number of 1s in the row/column, and 0 means an even number of 1s in the row/column
        - This way, if a bit in the "grid" is changed, you can just redo all the row/column calculations and, if both the column AND the row bits don't match, we've got the coordinates of the corrupted bit (row/column) and can change it back!
            - What if the parity bits THEMSELVES change, though? Well, then either a column or row will change - but not BOTH, so if only one of them is invalid, we assume it's the parity bit that was corrupted, not the data
        - Now, if we expect multiple bits to change at a time, we can add more dimensions to this scheme to handle that - but it gets MUCH more tricky
    - "This isn't the only scheme for parity bits, of course - there are a BUNCH of them - but its a good scheme to teach for this class"

- Alright, that about wraps our discussion of file systems for this class - now, LET US PROCEED GLORIOUSLY ON TO NETWORKING!
    - "We're only covering a pretty thin part of the networking chapter"
        - (...this quickly got messy)
    - Believe it or not, the internet is NOT run through a physical switchboard connecting every computer in the world, operated by an elite team of highly-trained monkeys - it's largely wireless!
        - ...even if we were so blessed, though, the underlying principles wouldn't change too drastically
    - To send data to another computer, you need to know its "name" (usually in the form of an IP address)
        - Forwarding vs routing - forwarding is just sending a packet to the next computer, routing is figuring out where to go next to get closer to your destination
        - What's a protocol? There's a BUNCH of them, but (kind of like an interface) it's a set procedure for how to exchange data between something (format, what information gets sent back-and-forth, etc.)
    - On every packet, it has a record of the maximum number of hops it can go through (TTL) - if that counter reaches zero, the packet gets sent back to the original sender to tell it that the destination couldn't be found - either because it took too long, or because there was no destination with that address
        - So, what happens with a tracert? Well, it sends a packet 1 hop, gets the name of that router, sends another 2 hops, gets that router...and gradually builds up a map of the routers it's going through
            - "Now, the internet was designed in the midst of Cold War apocalypse fears, so it is built upon VERY robust systems" - (mentions how secure DNS systems are built and connected)

- Last lecture on Tuesday - come one, come all!
