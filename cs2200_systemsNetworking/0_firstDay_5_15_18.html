//**************** CS 2200 First Day - May 15th, 2018 ***********************//
//**************************************************************************//

- 15 minutes early once again...blaming a later start time/my own impatience
- 9:57 - Professor Moss arrives with TA escort
- 10:03 - Screen projectors deployed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Mark Moss, lecturer for DCI ("Digital Computing Instruction"?) here at GT
    - Army officer for 25 years: "In the government, you WILL use Windows and 
    you WILL like it!"
        - ...except in the photo lab. For some reason, the Army's photo labs 
        always seem to use Apple products
    - Worked in US Cyber Command, at JACWC - the "Joint Advanced Cyber Warfare 
    Course", where he'd instruct people in cyber security
    - Worked for ~3 years as a researcher at John Hopkins
- TAs are John, Shannon, and Mitchell
    - ...actually Jack, but hey, it's his first day

- "So, right now, we're still gonna be on T-Square as we prepare to transition 
to Canvas in the fall"
- Obviously, 2 hours is a LONG time to just sit in lecture, so I'll try to make 
this interactive, give you small breaks here and there, etc.

- To quickly hit a few highlights from the syllabus:
    - TA office is in CoC 103, apparently next to the pizza location (wait, we 
    have one of those?)
        - TA office hours will be posted shortly
    - Official office hours are in CoC 134b (back-right), from 9am - 12pm on 
    Mondays, but feel free to drop by if the door is open
    - Do NOT email me unless it's honestly an emergency; any general questions 
    should be posted on Piazza
    - We WILL actually use the textbook, so please get a copy! It's important! 
    And written by Bill Leahy!

- "The construction of this course is...um, unique, compared to other colleges. 
I personally really like it, but let's walk through how it's structured."
    - So, what have you heard about this course? "2110 on steroids", intro to 
    how operating systems work, more hardware-focused than 2110...(annnnnnd 
    then the class got shy)
        - "Those are all pretty fair comments, and yes, we'll get to ALL of 
        them!" 
        - Remember the LC-3 from 2110? That's a functional processor, but it's 
        still a far cry from how ACTUAL modern computers work; in this class, 
        we'll be going over the "enduring principles" behind modern processor 
        design, the trade-offs designers face, etc.

- So, most of you brought computers, right? Let's try having a little scavenger 
hunt of things you SHOULD be able to find on your computer:
    - What CPU does your computer have? (Intel 2.6ghz i7-6700HQ)
        - "The LC-3 had just 1 core, but I'd guess most of your laptops have at 
        least 2, maybe 4...unless you're a gamer. Then it goes up."
        - How do we coordinate those cores? How do we keep them in sync?
    - How much RAM? (16gb, currently using 7.4gb)
        - The LC-3 had a LOAD-STORE architecture, where we have to take 
        information from memory and put it into registers, where we actually 
        operate on it; but conceptually, we could ALSO directly operate on 
        information in memory
    - What types/kinds of devices are on your system?
        - Keyboards, microphones, camera, display, mouse, USB ports, hard 
        drives...
        - More fundamentally: 
            -For storage, we've got registers, caches, disk I/O, etc; does the 
            order we handle these in matter? How do we schedule 
            retrieving/adding information? Can we do things in parallel?
            - For processing, we've got multiple cores; how are they wired 
            together?
            - For I/O, we might have FireWire, USB, etc.
            - Then, we have networking cards that let us reach out and connect 
            to other devices; this dramatically increases the power of our 
            SYSTEMS, since we're now not dealing with an isolated machine, but 
            a group of them
        - "The processor doesn't just run in a vacuum; it has to reach out and 
        touch all of these actual, physical devices"
    - How are these controlled by the OS? What are the "drivers" for all of 
    these?
    - How many applications/processes are running on your system? (Task 
    Manager, go! 7 apps and 115 processes)
        - What's the difference between a program and a process? "A 
        PROGRAM/application is what a standard user sees and interacts with, 
        and the computer code instructions that comprise it; to run it, you 
        then need to create PROCESSES that will actually take that code, 
        allocate memory for it, and execute it"
- "The operating system has to know ALL of this information because it plays so 
many roles; it has to do a bunch of things at once to make the computer work 
smoothly in a modern way"

- The GOAL of this course is NOT to just teach you a bunch of vocab terms, but 
to teach you the CONCEPT behind theses systems and why they are the way they are
    - "We don't want to just say, 'this is pipelining, learn it, go!'; but to 
    also ask those questions like 'why didn't we stop at the LC-3? What was 
    their motivation?'"
        - e.g. "load-store" architectures (using registers instead of just 
        memory) originated because it was an order of magnitude faster than 
        trying to load everything from memory; we can take something out of 
        memory, do a BUNCH of calculations with it, and then put it back. 
            - "The old way was like taking a book out of the library, writing 
            one sentence down, putting it back, THEN getting the same book for 
            the next sentence and putting it back AGAIN, and so on...instead of 
            just keeping the book"
    - We'll learn about how the OS operates as an accountant, a manager, and 
    even an "illusionist" in a sense (with virtual memory) in order to squeeze 
    the most potential out of all of its resources
        - How can multiple processes run at the same time? How can they run 
        without corrupting one another? 
            - On old Apple II computers, this just DIDN'T WORK - it was like a 
            kindergarten teacher saying "play nice!" to a bunch of kids and 
            leaving the room - but NOW, in modern computers, each process can 
            pretend it's the only one running on the computer ("I'm king of the 
            CPU!"), and the OS manages to keep all of them running fine. 
                - ...how? Well, we'll learn that in this course!
    - Furthermore, we'll learn about networking (how different computers share 
    information)

- Alright, let's take a step back now - we talked about the course's purpose as 
"a broad exposure to computer system structure," we did the crazy scavenger 
hunt, and I KNOW, from experience, we have a tendency to compartmentalize what 
we learn: "I am now studying processors. I am now studying OS design..." but 
SYSTEMS are made up of multiple components all INTERACTING; we have to connect 
all of these concepts, not just put them in their own neat little boxes!
    - "Because of that, I'm going to largely focus on the BREADTH of these 
    topics and how they interrelate; although we'll certainly try to not ignore 
    depth, it'll be a change in focus"
- Some of the topics we'll hit:
    - How the processor is organized
    - Memory hierarchy - volatile vs non-volatile memory, virtual memory, how 
    does memory interact with storage, etc.
    - Parallel processing - How pipelining and scheduling improve performance 
    and allow for programs to run at the same time
    - Networking protocols - how do we trade data between machines?
    - Software abstractions that OS's use, ESPECIALLY the process paradigm
- "We don't have time to cover ALL of these in-depth, but we'll touch on all of 
them, and, hopefully, tie them together with how these parts form modern 
systems. Breadth over depth."

- Most projects will have demos, where you have to explain your work to the 
TAs, just like in 2110. Once you sign up for a demo, if you miss it without 
rescheduling ahead of time, it counts as a 0%
    - The HOMEWORKS are distinct from the projects, and aren't meant to be 
    super-tough impossible stuff, but instead as checks to make sure you get 
    the concepts we've covered in-class
        - "Using the homeworks as exam prep might be a good idea"
    - Projects are a little more intense, but should still be reasonable; 
    still, PLEASE start early on them
- We'll have 2 EXAMS in-class, along with a final
    - Once you've gotten an exam back, you'll have a week to submit a regrade 
    request - read the feedback, say WHY a higher grade is justified, etc. etc.
- Late-work policy is currently being revised, but shouldn't be too different 
from what we have now. Turn in stuff on-time, and you'll be fine.
- If an honest emergency comes up, and you feel like it'll affect your ability 
to work in this course, PLEASE reach out to Student Services immediately. Don't 
hide it; we'll work with you.
- Plagiarism: "I've got no illusions that I'm the only way for you to learn, 
and if you can learn better from other students or other resources, GREAT! BUT, 
if you're sharing source code, you've gone too far. A few dozen students every 
semester get nailed for this, and please, don't be one of them. You won't learn 
and you'll just get in trouble."

- You WILL be graded on Piazza participation, so please try to answer one 
another's questions!
    - What we're looking for: NOT based on pure # of messages posted, but based 
    on if you're trying to give good answers
- 25% of the grade will come from projects, 10% from the homeworks, and each 
test (the 2 exams + the final) will be worth 20% each
    - The final will NOT be cumulative, but should just be another exam
    - CURRENT date for the final is August 1st, 8-11am in this room (Mason 
    1133), but that is subject to change
- The projects:
    - Datapath: Similar to the LC-3 datatapth you made in 2110, but a more 
    realistic view of how a processor works
    - Pipelining: We'll be taking the datapath we built and improving its design
    - Virtual Memory: (missed this)
    - Caching: What's caching, and how does it improve our performance
    - Multithreading: how do we get multiple threads to work together?

- ...aaaaannnnnnnndddd that's day 1! We'll hit the ground running with 
processors and the datapath on Thursday!
