//************** Introduction to Filesystems- July 17th, 2018 ***************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Alright, today we're going to start going over filesystems...starting with an 
exercise!
    - Need to create the folder "universe" and move the crayola files into it
    - Need to create the sub-folders (inside universe) of "glass", "paper", 
    "stone"
        - For "glass":
            - Move "blue.txt" and "silver.txt" to here
            - create "tinted," an alias to black.txt 
            - Create "polarized," a symbolic link to brown.txt
        - For "paper":
            - Move "white.txt" to here
            - Create symbolic link "cream" to yellow.txt
            - Create alias "recycled" to brown.txt
            - Create sub-folders "apple" and "orange"
                - Move "red.txt" to apple, "orange.txt" to orange
                - Apple should have "granny_smith" alias to green.txt, and 
                symoblic link "fuji" to yellow.txt
        - For "stone":
            - Move "grey.txt" to here
            - Create sub-folder "kiwi"
            - Create alias "ash" to "black.txt" (use )
- Useful commands for this:
    - "mv &lt;file&gt; &lt;new folder&gt;" Moves the specified file into the new folder
    - "mkdir &lt;new folder name&gt;" Makes a new folder w/ the given name
    - "touch &lt;name&gt;" Creates a file with that name
    - "ln &lt;path&gt; &lt;new name&gt;" Creates the "new name" file and makes it 
    physically equivalent to the original path (for aliases)
    - "ln -s &lt;path&gt; &lt;new name&gt;" Creates the "new name" REFERENCE to the 
    original path file (for symoblic links)
- Some quick notes:
    - "aliases" are hard links to the file (basically shortcuts that point 
    directly at the original file), but they ALSO contain the information in 
    the original file; "symbolic links" are "soft" (point to the reference 
    they're copying, NOT the original file itself) 
        - Because of this, hard links are still usable after the original is 
        deleted, but soft links become just "hanging references;" on the other 
        hand, soft links can point to non-file things (e.g. directories) and 
        span across partitions
        - "Hard links point to the file itself, and deleting the original file 
        just deletes one pointer to that file; soft links point to another 
        POINTER to that file instead of the file itself"

- Continuous allocation vs Linked allocation (missed the distinction, will 
probably come up on the final (11.1-11.3))
    - Most systems have a "FILE ALLOCATION TABLE," which keeps track of which 
    "data blocks" on the disk a given file is using
        - This tends to grow large pretty quickly, so often this is done via 
        INDEXED ALLOCATION, where the table is broken up into "i-nodes" for 
        each file; each inode keeps track of the data blocks used to store the 
        file
            - We can have even MORE indirection by having multiple levels, with 
            inodes pointing to inodes pointing to the actual data blocks
            - Practically, most modern systems have a hybrid form of indexed 
            allocation
        - So, for instance, if we have a UNIX directory "root," there'll be an 
        inode containing pointers for "." (the folder itself) and ".." (the 
        parent folder, which, for the root, will also be itself)
            - If we create a "program.txt" file inside the folder, the root 
            folder will get a 3rd entry in its inode called "program.txt" 
            (pointing to the file), and the program will have its own new inode 
            pointing to the file's actual contents
            - Similarly, if we create a child folder "paper" in the root, it'll 
            get a 4th entry in its inode pointing to paper, and the paper 
            folder will have its own new inode with 2 entries: "." and ".."
                - So, paper would have 1 link (since root in pointing to it), 
                root would have 3 links (since both "." and ".." point to it, 
                as well as paper's ".." link), and paper will have 2 links (one 
                from root, and one from its own "." pointing to itself)

- So, filesystems are great when they work, but that's not what people care 
about when they come knocking on your help desk - how do these filesystems deal 
with crashes (11.7)? 
    - Believe it or not, one of the greatest user innovations in computing is 
    the recycle bin holding files before they're deleted - it's AMAZING how 
    often people accidentally delete things, so giving that a second chance is 
    great
    - Systems can crash for a number of reasons; upon failure, the system will 
    try and write a "crash image," and upon booting up the system will check 
    the crash image and the file system to make sure they're consistent 
    - To handle elegantly dealing with file changes, when files are 
    added/deleted/modified, we write this to a TRANSACTION LOG, keeping track 
    of all the changes we're going to make AS WELL as a "transaction #x 
    committed thing"
        - Then, if the system crashes, we save the transcation log; after 
        starting the system back up, if a given transaction has a "commit" 
        command finished, we save those changes; if we don't find a "commit" 
        for a given transaction # in the log, then the crash interrupted some 
        changes before they could be added to the log, so we drop all those 
        changes and pretend they didn't happen (check this?)
