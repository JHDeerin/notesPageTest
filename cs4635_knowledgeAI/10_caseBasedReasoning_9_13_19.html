//*************** Case-Based Reasoning - September 13th, 2019 ***************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Ooooh, Friday the 13th, spooooOOOOOOoookyyyyy...
- So, let us begin the day in the traditional way: by watching a YouTube video!
    - Cue video on case-based reasoning for playing soccer, where agents observe a player and try to match observations to what the player does, and act based on its memory (tries to mimic a given teacher)
        - This would be similar to KNN, and it has a problem: it's only useful for retrieval, not for actual reasoning!
    - To try and fix this, we're going to make 2 moves that've been very important in KBAI
        - We operate on 2 systems: an unconscious, memory-based heuristic system, AND a slower, more thoughtful deliberation system
            - Thus far, we've been talking about system 2; NOW, we want system 1, since we want to build human-level, human-like intelligences in this field
                - You don't think about how to remember what you had for lunch today, or how to eat with a fork - you just do it! You just use your memory!
                - That being said, transferring knowledge from one situation to another isn't always trivial, especially if the situations aren't very similar
            - "We think that we think a lot, but really, most processing is going on at the unconscious level"
                - By that definition, these soccer robots aren't truly thinking - they're just remembering
        - The second big move is that intelligence is SOCIAL, and that we don't Skynet our way into genius - instead, we learn from one another and imitate one another (whether consciously or not)
            - This happens often when you travel to a new country; when you don't know what the etiquette is, you do what your friends are doing!
            - Under current theories of AI, if these agents ever become sentient, they'll develop their own culture and their own societies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Last time, we said that in production systems the core method of learning is CHUNKING: creating new rules to deal with uncertain situations
    - Today, we're going to talk about how skills might be transferred between different agents
    - Here, we're moving away from procedural knowledge and towards episodic knowledge
        - Remember: episodic knowledge is event-based, procedural is rule-based, and semantic we haven't covered in detail yet (but will get to)
- "This lesson will probably seem very simple - that's all? - but the idea we're building here is that AIs experience a bunch of things, they remember them as cases, and then they extract rules and concept from these cases"
    - It's also the very beginning of our exploration of creativity by analogy

- So, imagine there's a 2D world entirely composed of colored blocks; they might see one block is purple and squat, another block is square and green, and so on
    - Let's say we see the outline of a new block, and can't tell what color it is - we might say "well, it's the same shape as the black block, so it's probably black!"
        - Story time: when Jill Watson was first built in 2016, it used case-based reasoning, where they had 40,000 different questions/answers from past years of the class stored, and it would try to find the closest match and then use the exact answers from previous TAs
            - The current Jill Watson AI uses a different technique, where its answers sound more "robotic", although with a similar correctness rate
            - Why did we change this? For ethical reasons, actually; some people objected to not telling the students that this was an AI TA, saying it was deceptive (mostly in the press, not so much among the students)
                - So, to protect Georgia Tech's reputation, they switched it to a different method that gave less human answers, but was less controversial - which was a small sacrifice, since the responses didn't "feel" as natural
            - More importantly, though, the old Jill Watson showed a gender bias! About 85% of the questions in Jill Watson's question bank had been asked by men, due to the demographics of the class
                - One semester, a male student mentioned that his wife was expectant, and Jill gave a very nice response welcoming him to the class and congratulating him. The next semester, a female student had mentioned she was pregnant and would have to leave the class early with her husband, and all Jill said was "Welcome to the class" - because we didn't have a recorded case of a female student asking that kind of question before!
            - Another, smaller issue they had to deal with was implementing "forgetting" old cases, so Jill wouldn't give outdated information

- Anyway: the gist of case based reasoning is that, given a new problem, find the most similar problem we have in memory, and use the answer for that remembered problem
    - Specifically, this is known as the NEAREST NEIGHBOR algorithm; this is literally computing the distance from our input to each point, and picking the closest one

- We'll talk more about this - and its limitations - next week</pre>
