//****************** Planning (cont.) - October 4th, 2019 *******************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Alright - yesterday, we mentioned the "society of mind" theory of intelligence, where our intelligence is actually made up of a number of extremely simple interacting agents
    - We also wanted to start talking about PLANNING, and making good plans to achieve a goal
        - We'll assume that logic gives us the right notation to identify dependencies between different plans
        - We'll also assume this society of mind theory, where we'll have gents that generate plans, others that critique those plans, and others that fix the critiques

- Let's assume we start off in this initial state:

        On(Robot, Floot) AND
        Dry(Ladder) AND 
        Dry(Ceiling)

    - We'll then have a goal state we want to get to:

        Painted(Ceiling) AND
        Painted(Ceiling)

    - To do stuff, we need to give our agent things it can do - OPERATORS!
        - Each operator will have a set of pre-conditions and post-conditions, known as the STRIPS notation
            - For instance, a "climb-ladder" condition might look like this:

                climb-ladder:
                    PRE:
                        On(Robot, Floor)
                        Dry(Ladder)
                    POST:
                        On(Robot, Ladder)

        - We'll assume that the postcondition will NEVER have a negation (this is just a convention STRIPS notation uses, and we can get the same effect by altering the preconditions)
            - Notice that explicitly stating the ladder must be dry means we can figure out exactly what operations we can do at any given time!
    - We make plans all the time - but why do our plans work most of the time? What enables us to make good plans - what to have for lunch, how to get back home today, and so forth?
        - If I were to ask you, you probably wouldn't know; you don't explicitly think about these pre/post-conditions
            - This is part of what's sometimes called the QUALIFICATION PROBLEM in AI: there may be MANY pre-conditions we don't think about explicitly that're actually relevant (e.g. "house-not-on-fire", "has-paint"), and we somehow know which ones we can ignore/assume in certain situations
    - So, a few other operators we might have:

            paint-ceiling:
                PRE:
                    On(Robot, Ladder)
                POST:
                    Painted(Ceiling)

            descend-ladder:
                PRE:
                    On(Robot, Ladder) AND
                    Dry(Ladder)
                POST:
                    On(Robot, Floor)

            paint-ladder:
                PRE:
                    On(Robot, Floor)
                POST:
                    Painted(Ladder)

        - "How does the robot know these are the relevant operators? Aren't we cheating by giving the robot these in advance? The answer is yes - but that's not what we're worrying about just yet. The question NOW is given these list of operators, can the agent choose which ones to do"
            - We'll also give the agent some CONTROL KNOWLEDGE, letting the agent choose what to do first
                - We'd all agree the robot should climb the ladder first - but how do we know that?
            - One way we know these operators are relevant is that they end in "Painted(Ceiling)" and "Painted(Ladder)," which are part of the goal state!

- Alright, with our operators figured out, we can now use PARTIAL-ORDER PLANNING
    - Once we have our goals state, each part becomes a SUBGOAL; we then try to ask "How do I paint the ceiling? What are the preconditions?", and try to figure out what to do from there
    - So, we'll ignore the dependencies between each subgoal for now and just consider the "paint-ceiling" goal, and ask "What preconditions need to be fulfilled to do that?"
        - We need to be on the ladder, so we search what methods gets us on On(Robot, Ladder) as a post-condition, find climb-ladder does and so we do that first!
            - We then check what "climb-ladder" has for preconditions, find it's already fulfilled, and so that becomes our plan for this goal!
    - However, if we do the same thing for our "paint-ladder" subgoal, there's a conflict between them - we can't paint the ceiling if the ladder is painted!
        - How do we recognize that conflict? It's amazing our minds are so good at this!
            - One thing we can do is look at all the post-conditions of both the "Painted(Ceiling)" and "Painted(Ladder)" goal, and see if any conflict the other's pre-conditions
                - Sure enough, we see the "Painted(Ladder)" condition conflicts with the "Dry(Ladder)" condition of Painted(Ceiling)'s "climb-ladder" operation, so we can't do Painted(Ladder) before Painted(Ceiling)
        - Figuring out these conflicts from pre/post-conditions is EXTREMELY powerful!
            - "For instance, if you need to be thought of as a nice person to be a Georgia Tech Professor, but robbing a bank would make everyone think I'm a mean person, that means I can't rob a bank if my goal is to keep my job!"
    - So, we decide to fulfill the "Painted(Ceiling)" goal first, then do the "Painted(Ladder)" goal second
        - And finally, to fulfill the pre-conditions for the 2nd subgoal, we realize that we need to "descend-ladder" first, so we do that!
            - If it can't find a transition operator like this, what can we do? That might be where creativity has to come into play

- Amazingly, your mind can do this kind of partial-order planning in SECONDS, even in extremely complex scenarios! That's amazing!
    - ...assuming, of course, this is how our minds work

- Alright, we'll revisit this next time; don't forget to finish your midterm essay over the weekend!</pre>
