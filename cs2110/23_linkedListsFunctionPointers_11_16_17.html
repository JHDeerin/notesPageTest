//********* Linked Lists &amp; Function Pointers - November 16th, 2017 **********//
//**************************************************************************//

- So, end of the semester, so much work, yadda yadda - welcome to Fall!
----------------------------------------------------

- So, we were talking about linked lists yesterday - but one thing that we didn't cover was what we should do if malloc() returns NULL

        int addToFront(...) {
            (...)
            NODE *temp = malloc(sizeof(NODE));
            if (temp == NULL) {
                (...????...)
            }
        }

    - Well, we could have a status code like "2 = malloc_fail", and return THAT once we're done!
        - Then, when we're calling the method, we could surround the function call in a macro like IF_MALLOC_FAIL_PRINT_ERROR, or something
        - NOTE: There's something called "Hungarian Notation" that says that for a pointer to a type, you put a "p" in the variable anme (e.g. "pObject"); if it's a pointer to a pointer, you put TWO p's ("ppObject"); it's kind of fallen out of favor, but if you like it, feel free to use it
            - "A tip if you're a teacher: NEVER name a variable for a linked list 'ppHead'"

- Now, to REMOVE the head, you first check that head != null; if it doesn't, you then get the data in "head", set the actual head to "head.next", and free the old head 

- So, once we're done with that, what can we do with our linked list? Well, we could create a STACK really easily!
- We could also create a QUEUE, but there's an issue with that; we need to add node's to the back, but in order to do that, we have to reach the last node, which is an O(N) operation!
    - To make this easier, we'll create a TAIL pointer as well!
        - When we add the 1st node to the list, we point the tail to the HEAD node; after that, we leave the tail as-is until it gets to the end

- Now, to FREE the list, unlike in Java, we can't just set our Head pointer to null; we have to actually go through all the items and free them:

        void freeList(LIST *lst) {
            NODE *cur = lst-&gt;head;
            NODE *temp;
            while(cur != NULL) {
                temp = cur-&gt;next;
                free(cur);
                cur = temp;
            }
            lst-&gt;head = NULL;
            lst-&gt;tail = NULL;
        }

    - NOTE: You should ONLY ever free data that YOU malloc()'d (do NOT try to free() something on the stack), which can make things tricky when you have a struct w/ pointers to non-malloc'd data. What should you do?...well, disappointingly, it depends. In general, if you malloc'd it yourself and you're only using it here, free it; otherwise, things get complicated, and YOU have to make the choice of what to do.

- To make the linked-list generic, we change the "data" variable's datatype from int* to void*, making it a void pointer instead
    - Remember, void pointers ONLY hold the address, and CANNOT be dereferenced w/o being cast to a new pointer type
- Now, let's take a quick detour to look at function pointers
    - Let's say you work for a company that's making a new GameBoy game for kids ("which is a TERRIBLE idea, you know, but they're paying you bags of money so you kinda just shrug and accept it"), and it's a game that lets kids draw things. One day, your boss comes in and tells you it's getting better: they're gonna use Mode 4 to let kids ANIMATE their movies!
        - A quick thing about MODE 4: it's a mode in the GameBoy that lets you draw animations via page-flipping; it's faster, but requires some special techniques
    - So, you start making 175 new MODE4-versions of your existing MODE3 functions...but that's a lot of copy-paste
    - You think of making an if-statement in each existing function to check if it's MODE3 or MODE4...but all those extra "if" statements are slowing down the game
    - ...you know what, screw examples, let's just get to the meat of what function pointers ARE:
        - This is a function prototype:

                int f1(int, int);

        - This is function protype that returns an int pointer:

                int *f2(int*, int);

        - This is also a function prototype:

                void setPixel(int, int, u16);

        - This is function pointer:

                void *fp(int, int, u16);   //Wait, the compiler will think that's a protoype! This won't work!
                void (*fp)(int, int, u16);  //Phew! NOW the compiler knows "fp" is a pointer to a void _____(int, int, u16) function!
                fp = setPixel;              //Sets fp to the function address!
                (*fp)(3, 4, BLUE);          //dereferences the pointer, then calls the function w/ those arguments!

        - ...BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! As syntactic sugar, C only requires us to write THIS to call a function in a function pointer:

                fp(3, 4, blue);     //this'll work just fine!

            - Some people prefer this, since it's writing less; other people say you should EXPLICITLY de-reference the function pointer with the asterisk first to make it clear what you're doing
                - "I actually wrote Kernighan (who now teaches at Princeton) a note to see if he prefers the star or the syntactic sugar, and he wrote back! Basically, he said 'well, I prefer the star, but you can do whatever the heck you want'" </pre>
