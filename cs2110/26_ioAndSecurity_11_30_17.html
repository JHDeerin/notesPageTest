//****************** I/O and Security - November 30th, 2017 *****************//
//**************************************************************************//

- So, we're getting to the end of the semester, and you know what that means: it's time to throw a bunch of random stuff we didn't get to into the last 2 lectures!

- Archive files in C
    - Basically, takes .o files and indexes them ahead of time so that the linker can find their stuff very rapidly during compilation; a lot of the C standard library uses this
        - Curiously, the math library doesn't use this, which means we have to include the "-lm" option in our gcc line (double-check what this actually does?)
        - "If you take 2200, there's something very similar called the lpthreads library"

- Streams vs Blocks
    - Let's take a trip backwards in time, to the early days of computing...
    - Mostly, people were concerned with getting the computer itself working - NOT with passing data into the computer
    - Now, by the late 1800s, the U.S. Census bureau was taking 11 years to process the census data...if you forget your Constitution, the Census is taken every 10 years
        - ...this math did not work
        - So, what the U.S. Government did was approach an MIT engineering professor named Joseph Herman (?), and he created a new system for processing the census records: a system of punch cards that, once they were filled out, could be fed into a machine that processed them
            - Sure enough, this worked, and Herman later modified his machine to work electronically, creating a new company to sell them 
            - The company he founded evenually became known as "International Business Machines" - IBM
    - So, when computers came along, they adapted this punchcard system for their use, and that was how programs were passed into these computers in the early days
        - These people - because these cards were in 80-character long chunks - tended to think of program's data in pieces
    - When a company called DEC (?) realized how expensive actual punchcards were, they changed their computers to instead use long strips of (cheaper) paper tape
        - Because of this, DEC programmers didn't think of data passing into computers in "chunks", but as a STREAM
- The legacy of this in C is that files are passed in as "streams" of data, using the FILE pointer

- Character I/O
    - 4 relevant methods in stdio: int putchar(int ch), int getchar(), 
        - Notice that the characters are returned as integers - why? Because it allows the method to pass error codes as well - the values from 0 to 255 are used for ASCII values, and the rest are reserved for error codes!
    - "Now, if you're one of those exceptionally-talented-and-handsome students who run home every day after lecture and try out what I told you, you might write something like this to get some input:"

        while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
            putchar(c);
        }

        - Now, if you write this, you'll be surprised to see that when you type, it doesn't print anything out...you keep typing...finally, you hit enter, and the whole thing prints out! What the heck?
            - Well, when you do this, the operating system doesn't pass this input to your program immediately - instead, it stores all the "putchar" stuff
                - This is because of the OS's "terminal buffer"; you can disable this if you want, but then 

- fgets
    - When C was written, there was a function called "gets()" - "get a string"...we don't use this function anymore
        - Basically, it would accept characters from the user until it reached "end of file" or something, and then store it in a 100 character buffer
        - One day, a student at Columbia realized that if you gave it MORE than 100 characters, it wouldn't do anything special; it would just keep overflowing and overwrite the rest of the code! (have to double)
            - So, that's the story of how the first worm virus was created, the first programming student was arrested, and why we never, ever, ever use gets() in our program
    - So, "fgets" is like "gets" except we can specify how big the character buffer is (max number of characters we're accepting)
    -e.g.:

        char buffer[8];
        while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin)) 
            printf("Got %s\n", buffer);

        - This will KEEP ACCEPTING INPUT until it reaches an end-of-file; even if you type 300 characters, it'll just read that in 7 characters at a time every time you hit enter

- Formatted I/O
    - Stuff like printf, sprintf, fprintf, scanf, fscanf, sscanf
        - Now, scanf is a little...weird. Look at the documnetation carefully; how it works it makes sense, but it isn't very intuitive 

    - Now, printf has a signature like this: "int printf(const char *format, ...)"
        - That "..." means "keep accepting parameters past this"
            - In Assembly, it'll just take those extra parameters and put them on the stack, from left-to-right, underneath the 1st argument

    - An example program that uses this:

            int i = 0;
            int total = 0;
            int *ptr = &amp;numnums
            ptr++;
            for (i = 0; i &lt; numnums; i++) {
                total += *ptr;
                ptr++;
            }
            return total

        - ...this'll work!
        - So, in our C program, we can mess around with the stack! Does that sound like a good idea? No?
            - ...well, like so many things in CS, it depends

- Strings
    - You know how to cocnatenate 2 strings in Java? In Python? Easy, right! How hard can it be!
        - Let's say we write this:

                char *x = "Hello";
                char *y = " World!";
                strcat(x, y);

        - Run this, and...segfault!
            - Why? Because strcat is trying to put the SOURCE information (y) into the destination array (x)...but X doesn't have any extra room to fit those bytes, so we get a segmentation fault!
            - To get this to  work, we have to say char x[13] = "hello"; or something instead
    - So, if we have to do THAT for 2 strings, what if we want to concatenate MULTIPLE strings? What about a VARIABLE number of strings? What kind of black magic do we have to do to get that working...?
        - Well, we have to use this C standard library function: 
            
            - "char *strcatv(char *dst, ...)"

        - We then have to declare a va_list, pass it into the va_start() macro (which C provides us)...you can Google this
    - "Basically, whenver you need to deal with variable arguments in C, google 'stdargs'; there'll be some pretty helpful documentation, because doing it on your own gets complicated fast"
        - There's...other problems with strcat. More severe ones:

- Security example:
    - In the I/O slides, the "smash()" function is expecting you to pass in a maximum of 5 values...but what if the user passes in MORE than 5 values? Well, in that example code, it'll just keep writing into memory: instead of stopping at [4], it'll put the input into [5], [6], [7], ...
    - What if it wasn't just a careless user, though? What if it was someone who, in those extra memory locations, was putting CODE INSTRUCTIONS?
        - ...well, you've got a security vulnerability, friend. At best, the program crashes; at worst, you've got a virus that could cripple your infrastructure because YOUR computer now has malicious code executing on it.
    - A fairy tale that's come true way too often: a breach occurs in the Papa John's website, suddenly the servers are crippled, and NO ONE'S ABLE TO SELL PIZZA! They're losing millions of dollars a day, and suddenly a man with an Eastern European accent comes up and says: ah, yes, my company is aware of this issue; for about $20,000 a month, we can help secure your comapny. What does Papa J do? PAY THE MAN, of course! They need the money!
        - So, they pay him, the guy leaves smiling, whips out his cell phone and says "Okay, guys, shut the attack down."
- ..and what was the root cause of this? A BUFFER OVERFLOW ERROR!
- "More relevantly, a few decades ago, we hosted all our college code on a UNIX server, and I've had former students admit that they'd use these buffer overflow tricks to change their grades. How the times have changed, right?"
- Similarly, several years ago, Microsoft was having almost weekly data breaches; it was so bad that they were being investigated by Congress. So, one night, Bill Gates woke up in a cold sweat (I'm guessing; I wasn't there), and called all of his company to say STOP: We're shutting the company down, sending security experts to every facility, giving security training to ALL computers, and conducting a thorough security review of their systems.
    - As it turns out, there were a bunch of small features that Windows shipped with - small parts of Internet Explorer, the Aquarium Manager, etc. - that weren't coded with security in mind, but were still shipped with the program. In fact, it wasn't just these little programs that had problems - CONSISTENTLY, MS found that security had been underprioritized when they were designing their systems. It had previously been left as a "we'll take care of it at the end of the project" thing; that changed FAST, and nowadays, security is considered from the VERY START of the project, and all the way through, as an integral part of MS services.
        - How do these genius hackers find these buffer overflow (or "stack smashing" (I think; might be different???)) vulnerabilities? Well, they mostly just do "fluttering" attacks: finding where a program accepts user input, and pump in a bunch of random data to see if the program crashes or alters.
- So, the lesson from all this? Watch out for buffer overflows, program defensively, and: NEVER. TRUST. ANY. USER.</pre>
