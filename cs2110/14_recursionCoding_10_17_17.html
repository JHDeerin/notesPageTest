//**************** Recursion Example - October 17th, 2017 *******************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Brandon, the ol' head TA, is back to pay a visit! Currently works for Google; 
will not tell us what he does at said Googley Company
----------------------------------------------------

- So, let's write a little subroutine 
- First, let's write the program in Java; it multiplies two positive numbers 
using recursion:

    public int mult(int x, int y) {
        if (y == 0)
            return 0;
        else
            return x + mult(x, y-1);
    }

    - So, this recursively adds "x" to itself "y" times!
- Now, in Java, control starts at the "main" method, which is an idea it stole 
blatantly from C; let's use this to test our method:
    - "While we're on the topic, can main be recursive? Can it? Well, why not! 
    It's just another function, so of course it can be!...we won't write that 
    just yet, though"

    int main() {    //wait, is this C instead? Eh, who cares
        int a = 9;
        int b = 6;
        int c;
        c = mult(a, b)
        return c;
    }

    - Let's write this test method as a *simple* ol' Assembly program...
        - "This first piece isn't written as a subroutine or anything special; 
        it's just a normal piece of assembly code somewhere in memory, like 
        we've been writing":

        .orig x3000
        ld r6, stkinit      ;R6'll be the stack pointer (SP)
        ld r5, fpinit       ;R5'll be the frame pointer (FP)
                    ;;NOTE: "In Yale Patt's book, he moves the frame pointer 
                    after each iteration of the function, and stores it in the 
                    middle of the stack; why he doesn't just put it at the end 
                    or the beginning, or just keep the FP the same, I don't 
                    know. I personally don't like it, but that's the way the 
                    book does it, so that's the way I've written this program 
                    here."   
        ld r0, a
        ld r1, b
        add r6, r6, -2      ;Moves the stack pointer (REMEMBER: the memory 
        address where we're going to add the next spot to the stack) up 2 
        spaces; allocates space for 2 elements
        str r1, r6, 1       ;Store b right BELOW the stack pointer
        str r0, r6, 0       ;Store a right at the stack pointer
        jdr mult            ;Jump to our "mult" function
        ldr r0, r6, 0       ;Get result, stored at r6, into a register
        st r0, c            ;Store the answer in C
        halt

    a       .fill #9
    b       .fill #6
    c       .fill #0
    fpinit  .fill xbeef     ;Just some arbitrary # for the frame pointer
    stkinit .fill x6000     ;Start of the stack

    ;; Now, let's write our "mult" function; there's a few ways to do it, but 
    in this course, we just care if it's working; we aren't too concerned about 
    efficiency:

    mult    add r6, r6, -3  ;Space for return value, return address, and old FP
            str r7, r6, 1   ;Stores the return address on stack
            str r5, r6, 0   ;Stores the frame pointer on stack
            add r6, r6, -1  ;Move SP to FP position
            add r5, r6, 0   ;Move frame pointer to SP position

            add r6, r6, -2  ;Make space for 3 registers
            str r1, r6, 2   ;Store current values of R1, R2, and R3
            str r2, r6, 1
            str r3, r6, 0

            ;;...all the work so far is, basically, just dealing with the 
            method header; now, let's move on to writing the meat of the 
            function:

            ldr r1, r5, 5   ;"Y" is located at FP + 5 in memory, so get that
            BRn error       ;If it's negative, something's wrong, so like the 
            good anal-retentive programmers we are, we check for that 
            brp recurse     ;If Y's positive, we want to recurse, so skip all 
            this "done" stuff
                            ;Otherwise, Y is 0, so we should return 0
            str r1, r5, 3   ;Set return value to zero (sets it to Y, and  = 0)
done        ldr r1, r5, 0   ;Restore R1, R2, R3; do this whenever we return
            ldr r2, r5, -1
            ldr r3, r5, -2 
            add r6, r5, 0   ;Move SP to FP
            ldr r5, r6, 1   ;Restore the old FP to R5
            add r6, r6, 2   ;Point the SP at the return address
            ldr r7, r6, 0   ;Restore the return address to R7
            add r6, r6, 1   ;Point SP at return value
            ret

recurse     ldr r1, r5, 5   ;Get the value of y
            add r1, r1, -1  ;Calculate y-1
            add r6, r6, -1  ;Allocate space on stack for 1st parameter ("y-1') 
            str r1, r6, 0   ;Put 1st parameter ("y-1") on the stack
            ldr r1, r5, 4   ;Get x
            add r6, r6, -1  ;Allocate space on stack for last paramter (x)
            str r1, r6, 0   ;Put last parameter on the stack
            jsr mult        ;Call the function again; IMPORTANTLY, this will 
            change r7 to the current memory address location; therefore, when 
            we're done and run the "ret" function, the address will return to 
            RIGHT HERE, and the next line to run will be the "ldr r1, r6, 0" 
            line that stores the result...so, we don't jump RIGHT back to the 
            original call, but instead to the previous ecursive call until the 
            original "r7" address is loaded into memory. THIS IS THE RECURSIVE 
            PART! This is what makes us "unpeel" the stack as we go backwards

            ldr r1, r6, 0   ;Put result of the call into a register
            ldr r2, r5, 4   ;Get x
            add r3, r1, r2  ;Calculate x + mult(x, y-1)
            str r3, r5, 3   ;Put result in the "return value slot"
            BRnzp done

- "Now, you're all bright, young, attractive, etc. people, so you're probably 
looking at this JSR function call and thinking, "Hey, I should go back and 
trace this to see what's happening!" DON'T DO THIS. You do NOT have a stack in 
your head, and trying to trace this will confuse the **** out of you. Just 
trust that, if you've set up the recursive logic right, this'll work. If you 
have to debug it, check the logic first, and then use the computer to step 
through it."
    - "Repeat after me, kids: "I AM FROM GEORGIA TECH. I can do ANYTHING. Even 
    write a recursive subroutine to multiply. Even if I cannot visualize a 
    recursive memory stack in my head, because WHY WOULD YOU EVER DO THAT." "
        - "...and then add, um, I solemnly swear on my honor as blah blah blah 
        etc., etc."

- "If you're confused by this, or even if you think you understand this, I 
HIGHLY recommend you draw out the stack for this function and run through it on 
paper (NOT in your head). It'll definitely help the people who're having 
trouble, and it'll give you a good idea of what the computer is actually doing, 
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY...it might be a quiz question."
    - "Seriously, you'd do yourself a world of good if you took this code, 
    typed it up into complx, and single-stepped through it to watch the stack 
    changing. The first thing you'll learn is how many mistakes I made when I 
    taught this. The second thing you'll learn is how the stack works. The 
    third thing you'll realize is that, when you write your homework, you 
    actually have no idea how this works, and you'll panic, and then you'll 
    actually pay attention. And that's how you learn"
        - "And when you DO write your homework, and you have like 15 bugs 
        (because you will), you'll say one of two things:
            1) ****, I'm glad I commented this code for myself.
            2) Who wrote this!?...oh, right"
        - "More seriously, when you debug your code for the homework, load it 
        into complx and run through it step-by-step - but DON'T just 'look for 
        weird-looking things'. For EVERY STEP, think about what the computer is 
        SUPPOSED to do, hit the "step" button, and see if it did it. If it did 
        what you expected, great; so far, so good. If it did something you 
        didn't expect, congratulations: you know where to look for your bug. "
