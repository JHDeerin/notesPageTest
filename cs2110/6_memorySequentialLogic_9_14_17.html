//*********** Memory and Sequential Logic - September 14th, 2017 ************//
//**************************************************************************//

- QUESTION: How do we divide by 5 on a computer?
    -...as it turns out, this infuriating question on the study guide was a typo: it was meant to say "multiply"...
        -...I spent part of my life on that problem. -_0
    - Dr. Leahey's answer, nevertheless: "You can do simple division by sequential subtraction, right? And this'll get you the right answer, eventually, but it's slow...the way an actual computer would do it basically involves approximating the fraction w/ adding together divisions by power of 2 (which we CAN just do with bit-shifting), but the actual exact process is complicated"

- NOTE: Do NOT try to draw these circuits; they're too big and they'll show up on the screen too briefly. Watch the slides, listen to me explain it, and try to understand how these work. Take some brief notes if you have any flashes of insight, but really, just try and understand what I'm saying in the moment. That'll be the most helpful. If you want to look at the diagrams again, the circuits are all in the textbook.
    - "Is Game of Thrones on tonght? No? Well, then you have a free night to draw these circuits in Logisim! Seriously, though, that'll give you a much better understanding of how these work than trying to furiously scribble it off of my Powerpoint."
-----------------------------------------------------

- So, we have 1 D-Latch, right? Well, we want to make a memory with 4 addresses, each 3-bits long.
    - So, we need 12 D-latches to store these, in a 4x3 grid.
    - We want to STORE 3 bits, so we have a 3-bit input at the top, we each input connected to the input of all 4 D-latches in their respective "bit row'
        - However, the write-enable is OFF by default
- 4 memory locations, so we need a 2-bit input to select which memory address we want; we use a decoder to split this into 1 output to each memory
    - BUT, we also want to have the write-enable work, so we hook up ONE 1-bit input for "write-enable on/off"; for each of the decoder's output, we put it through an AND gate w/ the write-enable plugged in so we can ONLY access the memory when the write-enable is on as well
        - This way, write-enable is ONLY turned on for the memory location we want to write to!
- So, to write something in memory, we put the address in, turn write-enable on for that address, put in our 3-bit code we want to store, and boom! ONLY the location we wanted to store that input in stores it

- To ACCESS something in memory, we have each individual block's inputs hooked togeter, and we select the address we want to read from w/ a multiplexor
    - "Seriously, though, I REALLY encourage you to build these circuits in a simulator like Logisim. Just watching me build it isn't the same."
    
- "Now, there's always that one person in this class - I call them SuperStudent - who gets SO excited by this class that they don't build these circuits in Logisim. Oh no. They go out to RadioShack and actually build this whole 3-by-4 memory contraption."
    - At THIS point, just when they've completed their masterpiece, is usually when the Distinguished Looking Japanese Gentleman taps on their door and asks if they can buy their memory board.
        -...cha-$hing!
    - BUT, they want 4 bits of memory that store SIX-bit long data
        -... :(
    - BUT THEN, you realize that not all is lost! You can have a 6-bit input, 6-bit output, split the input in 2 3-bit parts between two SEPARATE memory locations, and then combine their output! AND IT'LL WORK!
        - SAVED!
- So, now that the SuperStudent is an internationally recognized vendor, the Very Distinguished Korean-Looking Gentleman comes tapping on the door and wants to buy your boards for a company...let's call them Sam.
    - BUT NOW, the catch is that they want 3 memory locations that are EIGHT BITS...you're heartbroken.
    - So, you're about to come clean, BUT THEN your little sister comes up with an idea:
        - (insert little sister's amazing idea here)
-..."Happens every year, I tell you."

-The POINT of this exercise, though, is that you can always make memory locations longer by doubling their size by hooking up subsequent gates - if you've upgraded your computer's RAM before, congratulations, you've already done this.
    - "Now physically, of course, as we add more and more memory, those extra gates lead to microsecond delays that can seriously degrade performance...but that's why we have those monkeys in the ECE department."

- SEQUENTIAL LOGIC
    - So, as we've said before, combination logic is ONLY dependant on the CURRENT input: you give it the same input, it'll always give you the same output
    - SEQUENTIAL logic, though it can also have some combinational logic-deciding parts inside it, can have its output CHANGED based off of what the PREVIOUS inputs have been...or, to put it another way, its output is based not JUST on what the inputs are, but also on what the device's STATE is. 
        - "Think of a stoplight - it could be green, yellow, or red, and it changes to a different color depending on what it's current color is."
        - So, to know what the output'll be, we have to know what the STATE of the system is.
- Now, briefly, let's consider the D-latch:
    - It's SIMPLE, which is great when we have to deall with 4 billion of the suckers; but it has a problem (something about triggers or level-triggered logic or somethinf, where the value is always stored if write enable is turned on; have to look at slides)
    - "For example, let's say I have a register with the number 42 stored in it, and I want to add 1 to it. So I read the value of 42 from the register, plug it back in with the 1 added, turn on the write enable...and BANG. Infinite loop, the input is being output which is getting input which is..."
        - This is called a "race condition", or "spin"
    - "Think of this like an airlock on a spaceship: We can open 1 door at a time, but you DO NOT OPEN BOTH DOORS AT THE SAME TIME OR BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN"
        -...right now, the D-latch is kinda like that; when we try to write and read at the same time, it's like we're opening both doors at the SAME TIME.
    - So, what if we made it so, metaphorically, we couldn't open both doors at the same time?
    - The way we fix this problem is that we add ANOTHER register to hold our stored value, and we MAKE SURE that their "write enables" are ALWAYS different by hooking them together with a NOT gate
        - So, one register stores the previous one's value while we change the other one; and BOOM! Our problem is solved!

- In fact, this was such a good idea that they said, "Well, if we can do this with registers, why don't we cut out the middleman and redesign D-Latches to support this?"
    - 

    -----------|*1st input   |-----------|*2nd input|--------
               |             |           |          |
    ---|NOT&gt;--write enable   |           |          |
      |                                  |          |
      |-------------------------------write enable  |

- This bottom input wire, hooked up to the "write enable"s, is attachedthe CLOCK (I think); it'll regularly switch from ON to OFF at a specific rate, so that the devices can ONLY change when the clock switches("1 clock cycle"); otherwise, the input will never go through
    - "Having this specified moment when we can read/write things makes designing circuits WAY easier"
- We then hook up a Mux to the input (NOT the clock) before hand, and attach the output of the 2nd D-latch as an input to the Mux, w/ an "enable" input to decide if the regular input / stored input is put through the "input wire" (I *think* this is so you can do operations w/ the stored info? Not really sure...)
    - CAN'T replace mux w/ an AND, since then we could write to board when we didn't want to 
    - "Enable tells us to 'ignore the clock and just not write anything', or to allow input through to our circuit (so input only goes through if enable = 1)"
    - (kinda confused about this section, need to look at it again)

- This whole clock input is called "Edge-Triggered Logic", instead of level-triggered logic like normal SR latches/D-latches

- COMMON POINT OF CONFUSION: In "Brandonsim", D-Latches are D Flip-Flops w/ set to high; they're NOT called "D-Latches"

- Now, we're about to embark on a most exciting journey: how a processor works. We have basic memory, we can do basic arithmetic...now we need a way to combine it: a way to enable/disable certain devices automatically so we can move data to the adder, do the work we wanted, and then move it back to memory for storage
    - So, we need a hardware device that TELLS everything what to do: what devices should stay on, what components should stay off...in other words, what STATE everything should be in.
    - So, we'll get into this discussion about "State Machines..." on Tuesday.</pre>
