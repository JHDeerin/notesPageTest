//**************** Floating Points - August 29th, 2017 **********************//
//**************************************************************************//

- "So, who's going to DragonCon on Saturday!?"
    - Apparently, admission is paid but the parade is free
- TONIGHT, at 6pm at Physics L2 in Howey, there'll be a history of computing lecture I'll give; it's OPTIONAL, and you won't be graded on anything I say in there, but I think you'd find it interesting
--------------------------------------------------

- So, BIT VECTORS!
    - This is basically a memory location where we treat a string of bits as an array of boolean "true/false" values
    - Now, most computer architectures don't let us manipulate individual bits; we instead have to do it in clumps of 16 bits or 32 bits or 64 bits (whatever the architecture specifies)
        - So, how do we manipulate individual bit values? We create a MASK
            - A MASK has the same # of bits as our bit vector; there are a few different kinds, but let's say we want to TURN ON (aka, SET) a specific bit on
                - Could also do it with multiple bits
            - Then, we would have mask of all 0s, EXCEPT have a 1 where that bit we want to turn on is
            - Then, we would use a bitwise or:
                vector = vector | mask
                - This would preserve the rest of the bits, but DEFINITELY turn our selected bit into a 1
            - To CLEAR a bit, with the same mask, we would use AND and NOT:
                vector = vector &amp;~ mask
            - To TOGGLE the bit, we would use XOR (since it's all 0s except for the 1 in the position we want to toggle, 1s and 0s will be preserved)
                vector = vector ^ mask
            - To TEST a bit, you would use:
                if (x &amp; mask)
                - returns true if the bit is turned on in the vector, returns false otherwise
    - The reason we use bit vectors is because we can easily enumerate the (something)

- FLOATING POINT
    - Historically, the State of Indiana once tried to pass a law declaring that, for educational purposes, the value of pi was EXACTLY 3, instead of 3.14
        - (...needless to say, it didn't pass)
    - Well, initially, hardware manufacturers used their own proprietary methods to represent fractional numbers
        - As you can imagine, when computers started becoming connected, there were MASSIVE problems with these multiple formats being used; CHAOS REIGNED
        - So, in 1985, IEEE came up with a standard solution to represent these numbers
    - So, what's the logical way to represent decimals? Well, the first thing that comes to mind is we just cut the bit in half and say, "the right half is the part after the decimal," right? That's perfectly logical; in fact, sometimes it's still used for EXTREME optimization purposes, but it has a problem: it cuts our range IN HALF
        - So, remember scientific notation? You have the BASE of 10 raised to some exponent, the SIGN of the #, and the part called the "normalized mantissa"; aka, the "actual number" part, which means that there can only be 1 digit to the left of the decimal place
        - Well, IEEE decided to use something like this, but reworked it to fit binary and base 2, to be efficient as possible, to have some way of representing infinity, "not a number" (e.g. for / 0), etc.
            - So, they decided to allocate 32 bits for the floating point #: 1 bit for the sign, 8 for the exponential part, and 23 for the "mantissa" (aka, actual # part):
                0 |  00000000 | 00000000000000000000000
            (sign)|(exponent) |    (mantissa)
                - And it's turned into a # based on this formula:

                    # = (-1)^sign * 1.(mantissa) * 2^(exponent - 127)

                - The "sign" is 0 for positive, 1 for negative
                - The "exponent - 127" lets us represent exponents from -127 to 128 (with the actual "exponent" part being from 0 to 255)
                - Now, is there ANY way to represent 0 with this equation?
                    -...NO! So, IEEE basically said that they would give up 2 cases for exponents: -127 and 128
                        - If the exponent part is all 0s (aka, -127), and the "mantissa" = 0, then the # = 0
                            - This means that there's *technically* a negative 0 ("1000000000..."), but it's never used
                        - If the exponent part is all 1s (aka, 128), and the mantissa = 0, then the # is INFINITY
                            - If the exponent is 128 and the mantissa is NOT 0, then it is "not a number"
                        - Everything else is just treated as a normal #, converted using the formula

            - So, let's turn the number "42.75" into raw binary:
                101010.11 //.11 means, basically, 3/4 (2^-1 + 2^-2 = 1/2 + 1/4)
            - Turning this into "binary scientific notation":
                1.0101011 * 2^5
            - Then, converting this into IEEE's floating point standard:
                0|10000100|01010110000000...

            - So, in floating point, 2 is:
                0 10000000 00000000...
            - 0 is :
                0 00000000 00000000...
            - 0 10000001 10100000000... is:
                - In binary: 1.101 * 2^(129 - 127) = 110.1 = 6 + 1/2 = 6.5
            - 0 00000001 00000000000... is:
                2 ^ -126 * 0.00000000...001 = 2^-149
                - This is the smallest # we can represent using IEEE's standard

- So, in CS 1331 we learned that we could do this:
    float f;
    int i;
    f = i;
    i = (int)f;
- Why did they make us cast this? So that we acknowledged that we could lose some precision when we convert from a float to an integer
    - As it turns out, though, we can ALSO lose information when we convert an integer to a float!!!
    - Why? BECAUSE an integer is represented with 32 bits; but a floating point # only has 23 non-exponent bits for the mantissa, so we LOSE those 9 bits!
        - "doubles" get around this problem by using 64 bits of memory (i.e. "double" the memory), so their mantissa has enough space to hold the full 32-bit integer (with some space leftover)
        - Specifically, doubles have 1 sign bit, 11 exponent bits, and 52 mantissa bits

- The floating point formula lets us quickly compare ("greater than" / "less than") 2 numbers by just looking at the exponent values / sign without having to "unpack" the number into a regular binary # 

- ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
    - So, ASCII is a datatype where each character is assigned a binary # code, from 0 to 256 (only first 128 are used, I think?)
    - Fun fact! *something something showed ASCII* (basically, the point was that capital/lowercase letter's binary codes are related)

- Hexadecimal was created by IBM to break up binary into groups of 4 digits, which gives us base-16
    - e.g. 1100|0101|0111|1110 = C A 7 E
    - To differentiate hexadecimal from binary (since you CAN have hexadecimal like "101"), we prefix it with "0x"
- Now, SOME people said "WHOA! We can't have LETTERS in a NUMBER!". So, they ran away and created octals instead
    - Instead of "0x", octal puts a leading "0" in-front to say that the number is octal (base 8); this has ever-since brought tears to many a C programmer's debugging session

- Now, TRANSISTORS: there are 2 ways to understand them:
    - To fully understand them, sit in Howey until a quantum mechanics professor shows up, and train in the dark arts under him for 4 to 6 years
    - To MOSTLY understand them, google "Britney Spears guide to Transistors", and thank me later
- MOS (metal-oxide silicon) transistors are kinda like switches, in that they can either let current through or stop it from going through
    - For N-type transistors, current will only flow through if you put a voltage on the "gate" terminal, wich will create an electric field that will allow the semiconductor to let electricity pass through
        - So, when the gate is "at ground" (i.e. at the same potential as the negative side of the battery), no electricity flows through
        - Then, when the gate is connected, electricity flows
    - P conductors are the opposite, and are "normally closed" and conduct by default unless you apply electricity to the gate
- A wire with a high enough voltage represents a 1, a wire with virtually no voltage 0

- Next time, we'll start tying these transistors together to make logic gates
