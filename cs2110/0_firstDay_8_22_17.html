//**************** CS 2110 First Day - August 22nd, 2017 ********************//
//**************************************************************************//

- 2:52: Right, nearly went to the wrong room, now hopefully in the right room, 
no sign of the professor so I can't tell...class is off to a less-than-typical 
start.
-3:01: Professor, still MIA; wunderbar
-3:04: Right, the Eagle has landed...and he's wearing a 2110 hat. Phew.
-3:09: class is actually starting
-----------------------------------------------------------

- "What've you heard about this class? Hard? Lots of work? Don't get behind?"
    - "...GameBoy?" *general laughter*
- "Well, I guess most of that's true!"

-Prof. William Leahy
    - "Do NOT call me a Doctor; I'm a 'Senior Lecturer' for the CoC"
    - Born in New Jersey, worked in France, been over half the world, and helps 
    run the CoC Art Club, Gamefest club, paintball club
        -"My daughters went to these schools..." (casually flashes the Harvard 
        and Yale logo)
    - Originally went to Georgia Tech to study Ceramic Engineering (which is 
    now usually wraped up in Mat. Sci.)
    - Worked for Corning for a long time, then went back to school for CS
    - Also helps run DragonCon, "COME TO DRAGON CON!"
    -...and yes, he likes trains
-"BUT, first and foremost, I'm a teacher"

- So, here's the usual "course objectives" first lecture

- FOR DEMOS, you'll be doing them in 108b in the CoC. It's next to the 1332 TA 
lab, basically.
-So, what's the course's point? "To understand how computers work!"
    -More formally, to understand "the structure and operation of computers"
    -So, we'll learn about some basics of electronics in computers, then learn 
    about assembly, basic computer concepts like runtime stack, i/o devices, 
    etc., etc.
- "Now, here's the question: can we really make this FUN?"
    - Students used to HATE this class, but while it's still a lot of work, 
    we've done our best over the past few years to make sure it's not boring, 
    slow, or useless
    - "So, if you're NOT having fun, come talk to me!" 

- Labs are a mix of normal "tutorial" recitations and "labs" that evaluate you; 
YOU ARE EXPECTED TO ATTEND
    - It is NOT just a "help session"; you are ACTUALLY GRADED for the work you 
    do in recitation
- TEXTBOOK: You'll have to get "Intro to Computing Systems" by Patt &amp; Patel 
(2nd edition); this has a GREAT first section on low-level stuff, but the C 
part is a little shaky, so we'll then switch over to Brian Kernighan's 
"Introduction to the C Language"
- You'll be using Linux in this course; we ASSUME you have no knowledge of 
Linux in this class, so we'll teach you how to do stuff, but you'll need this 
knowledge for later on in the CS curriculum
- We'll also use a software called "Logisim" to play with logic gates; we'll 
get to that when we come to it
- EXAMS: show up for them, or you'll fail. Yay :)
- Homeworks: ~1 per week. We DO allow some collaboration (so you can ask 
friends for help), but you're still expected to turn in your own work, and to 
UNDERSTAND all the work you hand in.
    - We also have cheat-finding software, so please...don't try. We send 
    students to the Office of Integrity every year.
    - "You've heard of a game called Destiny 2, right? My LIFE GOAL right now 
    is to play as much of that thing as I can next week, and I DON'T want YOU 
    to interrupt MY time filling out misconduct reports."

- FINAL: The final IS cumulative, so be aware of that now

- If you want to look at the syllabus, or find a class schedule, you can find 
it under "Resources" on T-Square

- Some BIG ideas of the course:
    - ALL computers in the world can compute the same kinds of things
        - They all do computation in the same way, roughly based on Alan 
        Turing's "Turing Machines," processing or altering a series of 
        instructions in sequence 
            -Broadly, individual machines would do functions that would take an 
            input and return an output, like "addition" or "multiplication," 
            and they could then be combined into a "universal Turing machine" 
            that could take a more abstract kind of input: a question; and 
            then, it would return the answer!
            - This is the basis for ALL modern computing architecture; your 
            smartphone might be less powerful than a supercomputer, but the 
            fundamental way their hardware works isn't really different at all.
                - "Your smartphone can do the EXACT same computations that a 
                souped-up gaming desktop can; it's just a matter of time"
    - There are LAYERS that make the electrons do our work
        - From "most abstract" to "least abstract":
            - Problem
            - Algorithm
            - Language
            - Machine Architecture (ISA)
            - Computer Microarchitecture
            - Circuitry
            - Devices
        - This class will go from "bottom-up," starting with the fundamental 
        electronic components and then gradually building up to an 
        understanding of how computers work as a whole, hardware and software
            - "This means you HAVE to know the lower parts of the order before 
            you move on to the higher parts; we're going to be building upon 
            your previous knowledge in this class, so if you don't understand 
            something we did, FIX THAT!"
    - Binary EVERYTHING
        -"One thing you HAVE to grasp as a CS student is whether or not you can 
        encode a set of data - if it's images or musical notes or whatever - as 
        binary data"
    - Computers store POSITIVE, WHOLE NUMBERS

- Now, every day, this class is going to be me...talking...for 75 minutes. 
That's boring. So, EVERY LECTURE, we're going to have a 5-minute break. So, 
after 35 minutes, hopefully every day, we'll take a 5-minute brain-break.

- GAMEBOY PROJECT:
    - "Now, I've said that as long as a decent number of people in my class 
    have, at some point, touched a GameBoy, I still have a reason to keep 
    living"
        - GameBoys literally don't have an operating system; they're SUPER 
        low-level, so you actually get to write a program that DIRECTLY 
        interacts with the system hardware
        - "Now, we'll be using an emulator, so don't rush out and buy a GameBoy 
        yet...at least not for this class"
- History of Computers:
    - The history of Computer Science is crazy, because it's such a young 
    field. No Mathematician has ever met Pythagoras, but Donald Knuth is still 
    walking around TODAY!
    - Next Tuesday, at 6pm, at HOWEY L2, I'll give a lecture on the history of 
    computing. It's totally optional - but I think it'd be worth it.

- So, WHAT TO DO before the next class:
    - Get your textbooks
    - Start reading them! (well, specifically the "Patt" book. The C book is 
    for later)!

------------------------------------
// Datatypes I
------------------------------------

- What's a bit? "smallest unit of memory", "1s and 0s"...that's all true!
    -A "bit" stands for binary digit (the name came from Bell telephone 
    engineers as their term for the smallest meaningful piece of information)

- QUESTION: What is the smallest # of bits we would need need to designate 5 
different items?
    - A: 3 bits! We can actually represent EIGHT states with 3 bits (2^3)

- BUT WHY, you may cry, DO WE NOT JUST USE REGULAR DECIMAL!?!? GAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!
- Well, in the early days, people DID try to create decimal-based computer 
architectures. And you know what? THEY COULD DO IT!
    - BUT, BUT, BUT...it was HARD. You had to measure the voltage in the 
    circuit to determine what state it was, etc. etc., etc., and eventually, it 
    became clear that just telling if a circuit was "on" or "off" was much more 
    efficient
- Now, a DECIMAL circuit, to represent all #s from 0 to 999, needs 3 "decimal 
bits" - one for each digit
- For a binary circuit, you need TEN: 2^10 = 1024
    - You NEED to know powers of 2 as a computer scientist; this is ESSENTIAL 
    for low-level optimization, and even if it seems a bit arcane now, every 
    computer in the world is based on binary architecture - with powers-of-two 
    divisions of information. Trust me, even now, you will use this math far, 
    far more than you'd ever believe.

- Inside a computer, a bit has NO IDEA what it's representing; it could be a 
music note, a number, an image - but really, THEY ARE JUST 1s and 0s. There is 
NOTHING inside the bits themselves that says, "I'm a music note. I'm an image." 
It's just up to the software to interpret this data for its own use. 

- DATATYPES: "A set of values from which a variable, constant, function, or 
other expresion may take its value. A type is a classification of data that 
tells the compiler how the programmer wants to use the data; e.g., the result 
of adding two variables differs a LOT depending on if they're strings, 
integers, floating point #s, etc."

- Unsigned integers
    - How many DIFFERENT numbers can be represented by 4 bits?
        - 2^4, right?
    - DIFFERENT #s by 7 bits?
        - 2^7, right?
    - By "n" bits?
        - 2^n, right?
    - Well, YES - that's absolutely correct! 
- BUT, sometimes we need to represent negative numbers, and then half of those 
bits get devoted to negatives
    - There are SEVERAL ways of doing this (i.e. representing negatives)
- SIGNED MAGNITUDE takes the FIRST BIT of a number, and arbitrarily says it is 
"0" if it's a positive # and 1 if it's a negative #
    -Remember the elementary-school algorithm for adding negative numbers?
        - If the signs are the same, just add as normal and keep the sign
        - If the signs are different, SUBTRACT the smaller from the greater, 
        and keep the sign of the greater number
    - As it turns out, this algorithm is difficult (though not impossible) to 
    represent via circuitry
    - So, a NEW method was devised for this, called "1's Complement"
        -Now, a 1 in front still represented a negative, but the way that 
        negatives were represented changed
        - NOW, negative numbers were gotten by "flipping" all the bits of their 
        positive counterpart (e.g. 1 = 0001, -1 = 1110)
        - However, while this made some of the math easier, it was still 
        required us to design special logic gates that performed arithmetic on 
        this sort of data
- Nowadays, we instead use somethings called "2's Complement"
    - Basically, we have a line of binary numbers that represents the numbers 
    in order, and when we want to add a negative, then we go BACKWARDS on the 
    line
    - Mathematically, this can be done by shifting all of the negative numbers 
    from 1's complenment DOWN 1 (e.g. 1111 no longer means "-0", but "-1"); 
    this means that, when we run these numbers through a REGULAR adder (circuit 
    that ALWAYS adds binary numbers together in the usual way, carrying numbers 
    to the left if a 1+1 is done (e.g. 0001 + 0011 = 0100)), we AUTOMATICALLY 
    get the correct result; 0001 + 1111 = 0000 (because the adder "loops" back 
    around to 0 if there's a binary integer overflow, at least for the 2's 
    complement integer datatype)
        - e.g. "What is the 2's complement representation of -13?"
            - Let "A" = 13 = 01101 //0 in front to show it's positive
            - The COMPLEMENT of A is 10010 (literally the binary gotten by 
            flipping all the bits)
            - THEN, we add 1 to the complement (10010 + 00001 = 10011)
                - So, the 2's complement representation of -13 is 10011!
            - To verify the result, let's see if we get 0 when we add 13 and 
            -13:
                01101 //13
              + 10011 //-13
              --------
                00000 //yup, success!
    - This method, however, leaves us 1 binary string that has not been 
    assigned a value in 2's complement(for 4-bit #s): 1000 (since we add 1 to 
    negative numbers, 0111 would be 1001 as a negative). Since it starts with a 
    1, it must be a negative, and since up to -7 has been already assigned, 
    we'll assign it a value of -8 (as the next negative number that hasn't been 
    assigned)
        - This is why we say that binary #s can represent 1 extra NEGATIVE 
        number than they can positive #s (e.g. in 16-bit, we can represent #s 
        from -32768 to +32767)

- So, RECITATION tomorrow - please go to that, and I'll see you on Thursday
