<pre>//****************************************************************************//
//********************* Last Lecture - December 5th, 2017 *******************//
//**************************************************************************//

- The last lecture of William "Bill" Leahy...well, for the semester, at least. 
I'm sure something will drag him out of retirement, superdetective-style.
- "Fill out the CIOS form," echo all of my classes at once...
- 3:01, we have not begun...wait, nevermind.
- So, what we're doing today: ARM ISA, and general course-wrappin'-up stuff
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Now, we teach the LC-3 to give you guys an introduction to the basics of how 
computers operate, assembly, etc., but every year a few people complain that 
we're only teaching them "fake computers." Well...
    - Assembly is basically the same; the instructions change, but the concepts 
    remain standard

- So, to remind you, ISA is an "Instruction Set Architecture" - assembly 
instructions that the computer is built to support

- ARM was, originally, a small company in the U.K. called "Acorn" who happened 
to land a deal with the BBC to design a computer for their instructional TV 
show.
    - Over time, the "Acorn Risc Machine" became increasingly popular, and the 
    now-named ARM company has produced 30 billion chips to date...it's slightly 
    popular
    - There are 2 relevant numbers for ARM processors: the ISA # (ARMv4, v5, 
    etc.) that defines what assembly commands the computer has, and the serial 
    number for the chip itself
        - So, what's the same between ARM and the LC-3? Well, quite a lot!
            - They both have "load-store" architectures, where values are 
            stored in registers, then into memory
            - Both have "fixed memory" addresses (?)
            - (some other stuff I didn't catch)
        - So, then, the differences:
            - ARM processors have a 32-bit address space, instead of the LC-3's 
            16 bits
            - ARM processors have multiple "special" modes: User, FIQ, IRQ, 
            Supervisor, etc., which it goes into based on interrupts, etc.
            - ARM *technically* has 16 registers, although there are actually 
            more
                - Registers R8-R14 can automatically accept user inputs when 
                interrupts happen (I think?)
            - They have shifters ("Here's a number, I want to shift it X bits 
            left or right") that are on the ALU
                - CLEVERLY, this is IN FRONT of the ALU - which lets us do 
                pointer arithmetic more quickly than normal!
                    - e.g. If we're trying to do pointer arithmetic with an int 
                    pointer, then we can shift by 3 bits to multiply the 
                    address by 8, add our address offset, then shift it back - 
                    this is a LOT more efficient than running it though the ALU 
                    multiple times!
            - Instead of "BR" for conditional branching, ARM architectures use 
            a "CPSR" ("Conditional Program Status Register" ?) to determine 
            branching.
                - Can prepend commands with "B" letter for condition 
                codes...not sure how exactly it's used
            - MANY more instructions...~200; this is harder to learn, as you 
            can imagine, but shortcuts a lot of the things we had to do with 
            our assembly earlier this semester
                - Still a lot similar to what we did - e.g. ARM's version of 
                "JSR" is the "BL" command, etc.
            - In assembly, different calling conventions
            - "Thumb" instruction set - this is a 16-bit subset of the full ARM 
            ISA, designed for ultra-cheap computers; these instructions are 
            simpler, it takes longer to write, but the programs themselves are 
            smaller (since 16-bit vs 32-bit)
    - ...remember where we've seen ARM processors before? That's right, the 
    GameBoy!
        - Remember how we told you during the GBA homework to NOT use 
        floating-point operations? Well, that was because the ARMv7 chip the 
        GameBoy used didn't have any instructions for dealing with 
        floating-point numbers; more modern ARM architectures, though, 
        definitely do!
- ...so, there's a TON to learn about ARM, but this is only 1 lecture, so 
consider this an appetizer for what's to come.

- Wrap-Up
    - FINAL EXAM: It is in THIS ROOM, on Dec. 14th, 11:30am to 2:20pm. DO NOT 
    MISS IT!
        - "I HATE having to give someone a 0 because they slept in or forgot to 
        take this..."
        - Practice test for Spring is still valid for this semester; whatever's 
        on the practice test will be the SAME TOPICS, but NOT the same 
        question. Don't memorize the practice test - we're gonna change the 
        questions to different scenarios - but the topics will be the same. We 
        might not have a QSort question, but we'll DEFINITELY have a function 
        pointer question. We won't have surprise questions on assembly or 
        anything; it'll be on the practice test sections.
        - To review for this, 4 things I'd recommend:
            1) Look over your old homeworks and quizzes; understand everything 
            you got wrong.
            2) Look over your notes from class.
            3) Read the Kernighan and Ritchie book! Not every single obscure 
            section, but the chapters on Structs? Pointers? definitely helpful!
            4) Do some practice coding! Write some code! The exercises in the C 
            book wouldn't be a bad place to start!
    - CIOS NOTE:
        - ...just do it.
            - "When Zvi Galil became dean of the CoC, he suddenly decided that 
            we would be a college that cared about teaching: a SHOCKING notion 
            to everyone except, well, me and Charles Isbell. So he took the 
            CIOS - which, honestly, we kinda forgot existed - and started 
            pushing it big-time. He started rating teachers by both what the 
            CIOS responses were, AND the response rate. Do it for me, do it for 
            the TAs, do it for Zvi...but most of all, PLEASE do it for me!"
    - So, the 1st day of the class, I went over the purpose of the class...and 
    it probably meant nothing to you. NOW, let me re-show you the learning 
    outcomes for this course: do they look familiar? Do you know them? 
    Hopefully you do! And may they serve you well into the future!
