//****************** Stacks and Recursion - October 12th, 2017 **************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Question for y'all: If I were to write a tiny program like, say, this:

        .orig x3000
        LD R1, A
        LD R2, B
        ADD R3, R1, R2
        ST R3, C
        HALT
    A   .fill 10
    B   .fill 20
    C   .fill 0
        .end

    -...what would happen if I ran this? 
        - Well, it'd work! This code is "position independent"; we do NOT need 
        this program to be loaded in a particular point in memory; we can put 
        it ANYWHERE, and the code would still work!
        - "This is SUPER important for writing robust programs; can you imagine 
        having to install every program in a specific folder structure? Or if 2 
        programs NEED to use the same piece of memory? It'd be nuts!"
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- So, for those who haven't taken CS 1332, a STACK is an ADT that's first-in, 
first-out, with push/pop methods
    - "To use a super-common analogy, it's like a Pringles can, where we put 
    things down in some order and then pick them up in reverse-order"
    - Other analogies: Pancake stacks, plates, tennis ball tubes, PEZ 
    dispenser, etc.
        - *actually pulls out PEZ dispenser, proceeds to eat multiple PEZ*
        - "Technically, the PEZ dispenser is a bad example, since we don't HAVE 
        to shift all the elements when we add/remove an object (in fact, this 
        makes it less efficient since we're doing extra work!)"
            - "It's also a cause of tooth decay, which is less than ideal for a 
            data structure"
    - Can implement the stack as either an array or a linked list
        - "In this class, we'll designate a block of memory to hold our stack 
        elements, and then hold the starting address of the block in a register"
            - Let's say we allocate a block of memory from x5000 to x5FFF
            - We'll put the address in R6, since R7 can sometimes get cleared; 
            this'll be known as the STACK POINTER
                - In this class, we'll say the stack pointer is the location of 
                the topmost element currently on the stack
                - "Of course, we could also say the pointer is the next open 
                spot in the stack, etc.; this is implementation-dependent"
            - We'll also arbitrarily say that we start adding things from the 
            END of the memory address (x5FFF), and work our way to the START 
            (x5000)
                - "In this class, we won't require you to check for stack 
                overflow/underflow; in fact, this is often checked by the 
                hardware in modern computers, so it isn't really required"
        - So, our initialization code looks something like this:

                    LD      R6, STKINIT
            STKINIT .FILL   x6000   ;Start at x6000, 1 past the end of our 
            stack; this'll represent that our stack is empty

        - Now, assume we have a value in R0 we want to push to the stack; how 
        do we PUSH?

            PUSH    ADD     R6, R6, -1  ;Decrement our pointer (since we're 
            going from the END to the start); this adds room on the stack for 1 
            new element
                    STR     R0, R6, 0   ;Store our element at R6 (current 
                    location of the SP)

        - Then, to POP from our stack into the R0 register:

            POP     LDR     R0, R6, 0   ;Load the current element
                    ADD     R6, R6, 1   ;Since we're done, increase our pointer 
                    to the element "below" the one we popped

- Assume we have this subroutine:

    ;;Subroutine that needs to use R1, R2, R3
    subr    ST R1, R1Save
            ST R2, R2Save
            ST R3, R3Save

            ;;===insert work here===

            LD R1, R1Save
            LD R2, R2Save
            LD R3, R3Save
            RET
    R1Save  .fill 0
    R2Save  .fill 0
    R3Save  .fill 0

-So, this should use the R1, R2, and R3 registers, but should save those values 
for the user, right? So our user keeps their values and stays happy!
    - ...but what could go wrong with this? What could cause this function to 
    fail?
        - ...RECURSION! If this function recursively calls itself, it'll 
        overwrite the stored values in memory!
    - There are 2 ways to solve this problem:
        - Disallow recursion in your programming language
            - ...FORTRAN actually did this...
        - Use a STACK to store the memory we're using! 
            - We "fill up" the stack as we're doing more recursive calls, then 
            "clean up" the stack as we finish, w/ each recursive call removing 
            the values it used from the stack
            - So, a BETTER way to store R1, R2, and R3 would be:

                ADD R6, R6, -1      ;Increase our pointer to make room for 1 
                more element on the stack
                STR R1, R6, 0       ;Store our value there
                ADD R6, R6, -1      ;Increase again, to avoid overwriting...
                STR R2, R6, 0
                ADD R6, R6, -1
                STR R3, R6, 0
                ;;...do work...
                LDR R3, R6, 0       ;Restore our value to the register
                ADD R6, R6, 1       ;Move back down
                LDR R2, R6, 0       ;...you get the idea
                ADD R6, R6, 1
                LDR R1, R6, 0
                ADD R6, R6, 1

            - "...now, if you show this code to an actual, honest-to-God 
            Assembly programmer, they'd fall on the floor laughing over this 
            code because of how slow it is. Assembly programmers are, well, 
            Assembly programmers because they're obsessed with efficieny (and 
            most of them are crazy enough to think they're better than the 
            compiler)"
                - They'd probably write something like this instead:

                    ADD R6, R6, -3
                    STR R1, R6, 2   ;We can use the offset for the STR command!
                    STR R2, R6, 1
                    STR R3, R6, 0
                    ;;...do work...
                    LDR R3, R6, 0
                    LDR R2, R6, 1
                    LDR R1, R6, 2
                    ADD R6, R6, 3

                 - "This avoids having to add 3 times; we replace our 3 adds 
                 with just 1!"
                    - We can use this same trick to save R7 from being destroyed
                - "A tip for when you're actually coding this: draw a stack 
                diagram to keep track of where you are in memory. It's easy to 
                get off-by-1 errors, skip locations, etc.; drawing it out will 
                help you think through what you're doing"

- Let's say we have this Java code:

    int foo(int x, int y, int z) {
        int temp = 0;
        temp = x + y + z;
        return temp;
    }

- To call this method, we'd do something like:

    int a = 7;
    int b = 4;
    int c = 12;
    int w;
    w = foo(a, b+2, c);
    
    -THIS bit of code is sometimes called the "CALLER"; the actual method 
    definition would be the "CALLEE"
        - The "Caller" has the responsibility of providing these parameters to 
        the callee; these parameters are put on the Stack, with the stack 
        pointer pointing to the LAST parameter added to the stack ("a")
        - The SP then points to the Return VALUE, then the return ADDRESS
            - "When we're writing the Java code, we don't know what these 
            addresses are, or what the Stack Pointer currently is. We just know 
            the position of our parameters relative to the Stack Pointer (e.g. 
            "a" would be at SP + 2 when we're pointing at the return address)"
                - Keeping track of a dynamic Stack Pointer is HARD, so some 
                years ago, some people got together and said, "What if we put 
                the address we want stuff to be relative to, put it in another 
                register, and get addresses relative to that?"
                - This is known as the FRAME POINTER; we store it in R5, and 
                it's great; we don't have to deal with the SP jumping all over 
                the place. We just use our addresses relative to the FP
                    - This means that, during recursive calls, we ALSO have to 
                    save R5 (as well as local variables that wouldn't be saved 
                    between recursive calls), to save the old frame pointer for 
                    that call  
                - Then, as we go backwards through our old calls, we assign the 
                return address/value for the current call, get rid of the local 
                variables, restore the FP...
    -...ALL of that is just to deal with the logic for the function call. 
    Literally, with 1 line of code.
        -...got pretty confused about here, so double-check all this
            - Hi, slightly future Jake here. On the REFERENCE_SHEET.pdf we get 
            for quizzes, there's a stack diagram on the bottom-right that shows 
            you the order you should be saving things on the stack. The basic 
            idea is just that, when we call a method, assembly code has to save 
            all the current registers and stack frame in a consistent order 
            BEFORE calling the method again; when the method is done, we then 
            tear down that "layer" of saved stuff we needed for our method call 
            and change it to whatever it was before
            - Look at the example in the next notes; it should make more sense. 
            If the example is meaningless, try coding it up.
    - On Tuesday, we'll actually code an example of this, and hopefully make it 
    more concrete
