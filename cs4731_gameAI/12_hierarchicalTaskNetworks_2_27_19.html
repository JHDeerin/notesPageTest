//************ Hierarchical Task Networks - February 27th, 2019 *************//
//**************************************************************************//

- "Sorry about the exam, guys - it's a thing I'm required to do."
- Seems most people did pretty well on it, but we haven't finished grading all 
of them
- Homework 5 is due on Friday (hopefully you've started on that!), and was all 
about the tactics your minions were going to use
    - Homework 6, though, starts to throw STRATEGY into the mix
        - Instead of killing bases, we now throw a powerful hero character into 
        the mix (deals more damage, has an area-of-effect attack w/ cooldown, 
        can dodge in certain directions, can heal at base, levels up if they 
        kill ANY other agent, etc.); because of all of these options, we now 
        need to plan a little bit more in advance (should we farm minions? 
        Should we go straight for the enemy hero, or level up first? When 
        should we use the AOE attack?)
        - There are 3 baseline heroes to test our solution against (just runs 
        and shoot, same but tries to heal, and tries to farm first and gain 
        power); for this homework, we have to:
            - Complete a partially-implemented behavior tree we'll be provided 
            with
            - Add some certain behaviors to our hero
            - Consistently "defeat" baselines 1, 2, and 3 by dealing 100 damage 
            to the agent, within 5000 ticks (HINT: none of the baseline agents 
            use dodging, or "lead" their shots (all the agents have the same 
            set movement velocity))
                - For extra credit, you can try defeating Professor Riedl's 
                solution, which DOES use dodging/leading (but might not use the 
                area-of-effect attack?)
            - Behavior trees are a little more complex than FSMs, but they're 
            pretty fun to play around with
        - Later this year, we'll have a tournament where we pit EVERYONE'S 
        heros/minions against each other, which'll be for extra credit
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- At this point, we're about halfway through the semester and about to start 
transitioning to procedural generation, but there's one more thing we want to 
cover first...

- With behavior planning, we've seen A* being used to let our agent make plans; 
as it turns out, there's an important variation of this called HIERARCHICAL 
TASK NETWORK PLANNING
    - This really only started popping up in games ~10 years ago
    - See, when us people make plans, we often think in terms of several layers 
    of abstraction; we plan to go home for the evening, which involves planning 
    how to "pathfind" our way out the doors of this classroom and into our car, 
    which involves planning our muscle contractions in a coordinated fashion...
        - BUT, since we've gone home 8 gazillion times, we already know how to 
        drive home, so we don't think about all that; we can just store that 
        information and re-use it
        - HOWEVER, if someone is blocking the classroom door, we might need to 
        "edit" that chunk of plan on the fly to get us around the person
    - High-level plans break down into mid-level plans, which break down into 
    low-level plans...
        - So, the idea here is that we describe each of our tasks as being 
        composed of smaller sub-tasks
        - PRACTICALLY, this has the advantage of us not needing to A* our way 
        through everything; we can re-use pieces of our plan, and we only need 
        to calculate one chunk of the plan at a time (e.g. don't need to worry 
        if we're going into our house through the front/back door when we're 
        still on the highway)
            - "Everyone know what Transformers is? It's the part of my 
            childhood that Michael Bay destroyed"
                - Recently, there was a Transformers game that used HTN 
                planning techniques because there were too many possible move 
                combinations, and HTNs allowed them to manage the plan's 
                complexity

- As an example of this, let's think of a task where we want to travel to a 
distant city
    - A TASK is a thing we want to do (like a goal, but...not quite; more like 
    a step in a plan), and METHODS are the various ways we can accomplish a task
        - For instance, if we want to complete a "Travel(x,y)" task, we can do 
        that in two ways:
            - If we're between 2 and 20 miles, we can use the "taxi" method (or 
            "Uber" for you young'uns out there)
                - This'd be composed of some sub-tasks, like "get-taxi," 
                "ride(x,y)," and "pay-driver", in the order 1-&gt;2, 2-&gt;3
            - If we're more than 10 miles away, we can do the "air-travel(x,y)" 
            method, composed of some sub-tasks like "get-ticket," "travel(x, 
            airport)", and "board-plane"
                - Notice that we're recursively using the "travel" task here - 
                that's allowed!
                - We might have some ordering restrictions on these sub-tasks, 
                too (e.g. 1-&gt;3 means we have to buy a ticket before we get on 
                the plane, but we're allowed to either buy our tickets 
                beforehand or buy our tickets at the airport)
        - At a certain point, we have "task primitives," which are tasks that 
        don't have any alternate methods/sub-tasks - "we have to stop at some 
        point and just accept there's one way of doing something that we can 
        use, for sanity's sake"
            - Each task will have some preconditions that must be met before we 
            use it
            - ONLY primitives have postconditions, since they're where our 
            actions actually get carried out
    - So, if we're at the University of Maryland and want to travel to 
    Toulouse, France, we'd call "travel(UMD, Toulouse)"
        - Since Toulouse is more than 10 miles away, we'll try to use the 
        air-travel method
        - We'll then try to "get-ticket(BWI, TLS)," but it turns out that BWI 
        airport doesn't have that ticket! Our sub-task fails!
            - So, what other methods can we use to get to Toulouse? We can try 
            "get-ticket" for another airport (like the purgatory that is Dulles 
            International - "I have literally watched my airplane take off 
            without me - multiple times - from that stupid terminal bus")
            - So, we do that, get our ticket successfully, travel to the 
            airport, and get on the plane - done!

- What does the planning algorithm itself look like? Something along these 
lines:
    - Given a task:
        - Pick a method w/ preconditions that match the current world state 
        (either randomly, first available, etc.)
        - Planning process (get to a primitive, do it, update world state)
            - Importantly, we only need to create a partial plan for every 
            given step; we don't need to pre-compute everything ahead of time
        - REPLANNING (if our plan breaks, we can backtrack and figure out what 
        we need to do next)
- A specific implementation of this is the SHOP2 planning algorithm; here's 
some pseudocode from the slides (I ASSUME this is SHOP2, but I'm not sure?):

    htnPlanner(State s, Tasks T, Domain d):
        p = empty plan
        t0 = some task in T w/ constraints met
        loop:
            if t0 is empty, return p
            pick any subtask in t0
            if subtask is primitive:
                modify s according to effects
                add subtask to p
                update T by removing task
                t0 = some task in T w/ constraints met
            else:
                m = a method for subtask w/ true preconditions in state s
                if m is empty:
                    return fail
                modify T by removing task, add subtasks of m w/ ordering 
                constraints
                if m has subtasks:
                    t0 = some subtask of m w/ constraints met
                else:
                    t0 = some task in T w/ constraints met

    - Like A*, this actually isn't that complicated of an algorithm; what makes 
    it work REALLY well for games, though, is that the plans it produces are as 
    good or as bad as the methods us designers write
        - The methods can be as simple or as complicated as we write them, 
        which gives us designers MORE control over the agent compared with 
        behavior planning
        - "We don't care WHEN the agent does these things, but we control the 
        chunks of action themselves; the AI just gets to decide the order of 
        them"

- Speaking of A*, what're the pros and cons of HTN planning versus 
"traditional" Behavior Planning with A*?
    - First up, the good:
        - HTNs let us exploit the designer's knowledge - if we know what a good 
        order of tasks 
        - This also means it can run faster than A*, since we don't have to 
        re-compute every ordering of these plans
        - Can delay thinking through all the details of the plan for later 
        don't need to worry about taxis in Toulouse until we get there)
        - Since we've pre-made these chunks of action, agents will still have 
        patterns of behavior - which is often GOOD for gameplay purposes!
            - In contrast, A* just puts things in whatever order "makes sense," 
            often at the cost of predictability; sometimes that's what we want, 
            but oftentimes it's detrimental
    - ...and then, the bad:
        - HTN plans are NOT guaranteed to be optimal, unlike A*; we can't add 
        or remove extra steps in the middle of things, even if the world 
        changes (e.g. if there's a No Ticket Required day, the plan still has 
        that "buy airport ticket" step!)
        - It's less "creative" than A*-based Behavior Planning, since there is 
        a set order to things (i.e. there's less of a chance for)
- So, we're basically choosing between speed and optimality, along with whether 
we need our actions to be predictable

- ...and with that, we're done with behavior planning!

- "Now, let's move on to a Powerpoint presentation that hasn't synced with my 
computer yet - PROCEDURAL CONTENT GENERATION"
    - A LOT of the techniques we've talked about so far "best practices" 
    that're more or less solved problems in the CS world; no one's publishing 
    papers on A*, for instance
    - In contrast, procedural content generation is still wide open as an 
    anything-goes field right now - we haven't figured out a "right way" to do 
    things yet, which is scary, but also really exciting!
- So, when we talk about generating content, what do we mean by "content?" 
Well, just about anything!
    - Game assets (sprites, 3D models, music, textures, etc.)
    - Game parameters (weapon stats, NPC behaviors, )
    - Anything else your little hearts can fit on this slide!
- What, then, is PROCEDURAL CONTENT GENERATION (PCG) itself? It's using 
computation to help us produce these elements of gameplay
    - We're using this to help lighten the load on game developers, and let the 
    game do some of the design work for us...

- But what sorts of games? What sorts of design work, and what problems does 
this raise? These are EXCELLENT questions, and we'll do a fantastically bad job 
of answering them next week! See ya!
