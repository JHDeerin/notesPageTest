//*********** Intro. to Procedural Generation - March 4th, 2019 *************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Okay, homework 4 has been re-graded; most people's grades have gone up, but 
you're still welcome to talk to the TAs if you have any concerns
- All the exams have been graded, but it turns out that Professor Riedl's 
answer key had an error when he was grading question 10, so the TAs are hard at 
work regrading everyone's work there
    - In almost everyone's case, people should've now gotten full credit for 
    that question now

- Answers for the first exam, then:
    - 1) Following about FSMs vs. Behavior Tress
        - It takes a little extra time to compute things in a behavior tree, so 
        this was FALSE
        - FSMs are Turing complete, so this was TRUE - FSMs can do anything 
        behavior trees can
        - YES, both FMS and behavior trees require the designer
        - YES, hierarchical decomposition does make it easier to design behavior

    - 2) FSMs vs behavior trees
        - NO, behavior trees aren't any faster
        - NO, it is possible to design FMS plans (just harder)
        - YES, behavior trees are easier to design plan-like sequences in
        - YES, hierarchical decomposition does make it easier to design behavior
            - (question here about hierarchical FSMs)

    - 3) Rule systems vs behavior trees
        - YES, rule systems are better for unexpected stuff
        - NO, they're not better for goals
        - NO, rule systems require more computation than behavior trees on 
        average
        - YES, rule-based systems allow for emergent behavior

    - 4) Behavior planning vs Behavior trees
        - YES, planning makes more realistic enemies
        - YES, makes enemies less predictable
        - NO, behavior planning doesn't lead to patterns of behavior (see above)
        - YES, it does reduce the amount of time to implement new NPCs (that 
        was one of the reasons it was invented!)

    - 5) When would we choose A* vs Floyd-Warshall?
        - If the world's dynamic, A*!
        - If the world is static and we have TONS of storage, Floyd-Warshall 
        (i.e. "All-Pairs Paths")
        - If the world is static but we don't have much storage, well, A* is 
        still better
        - And again, if the world is dynamic, A*!

    - 6) "How can formations reduce computation time in pathfinding?" One way 
    is for a single leader to pathfinding, then a formation can just follow the 
    leader

    - 7) Path network vs grids
        - a) One advantage of path networks: sparser network w/ fewer nodes
        - b) Simpler to deal

    - 8) Differences between A* for pathfinding and behavior planning: the 
    heuristics are very different, behavior actions are more complex/different, 
    non-spatial effects in planning, preconditions for behaviors, etc.

    - 9) From this behavior tree, there was a *little* ambiguity, but there 
    were basically 4 parts to answering this:
        - The priority list will NOT select the first sequence, since the 
        daemon is never invisible
        - It WILL select the 
            - The original answer was C, D, E (sequence ends when door fails), 
            then G, H when the sequence fails
            - ...BUT, some students figured "well, if the sequence fails, the 
            door sequence won't be executed," so it would execute C (try to 
            open the door), fail, then bounce to G, H
        - J will NEVER execute

    - 10) NOW, the horrible, no-good rule-based messy one
        - You could either work this from the bottom-up or the top-down; 
        basically, the rules will work out to:
            - Rule 1: Z attack Y
            - Rule 1: W attack Y
            - Rule 2: X attack Y

- Again, if you feel you got an answer right and want the TAs to take another 
look at your exam, you have a week to submit a regrade request
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Alright, we FINALLY finished up planning last class, and began moving into 
our procedural content generation (PCG) unit of the course
    - We've been doing all this hard work by hand, and want robots to do our 
    dirty design work for us, be it inside the game or just as studio tools 
    before a game is ever shipped

- In the beginning of the class, we looked at some different genres of games 
and how each of them used AI - now, we're going to look a few examples of 
procedural content in games
    - Let's look at a few specific games in particular
        - First up, the infamous No Man's Sky, which randomly produces a 
        bajillion planets without the designer having to manually design any of 
        them
        - Left 4 Dead, which places the zombies dynamically based on how well 
        the player is doing
            - Professor Riedl has talked to some of the designers who worked on 
            this game, and the zombies are ALWAYS spawned behind the players
        - Borderlands, which randomly generates ALL the weapons in the game
            - 5 minutes into playing this game, Professor Riedl got a "weak" 
            gun that happened to have a 30% chance of electrocuting enemies 
            instantly, and it made the game WAYYYYYY too easy
            - As designers, we have to be careful about what combinations we
        - Star Trek Online, which generates new alien races, star systems, etc. 
        - "It's like No Man's Sky but without the credit"
        - The Diablo series, which randomly generates all the dungeons every 
        time you play
        - From Dust, which is a civ-type game that dynamically generates the 
        terrain
        - Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, which generated a MASSIVE number of 
        towns and NPCs
            - They experimented with face generation for the NPCs, but it 
            resulted in asymmetrical faces that really creeped a lot of people 
            out
        - Fuel, which has a game world the size of Connecticut, and is able to 
        store a world that size only by generating part of it one the fly
        - Skyrim, which procedurally generates quests - "but only very simple 
        quests, like go to X, kill Y, return to Z" 
        - ALL the rogue-like games (like...Rogue) (or Moria, Angband, etc.)
            - Rogue was interesting for a lot of reasons, but mostly 2:
                - It used procedural generation to deal with permadeath, since 
                going through the EXACT same maze each time you died was boring 
                (other games just solved this with, y'know, checkpoints, but 
                this was 1980 and memory constraints were TIGHT)
                - The second thing, which has escaped Professor Riedl at the 
                moment
        - A TON of indie games, like "Minecraft" (which he won't show us) or 
        "Robot Unicorn Attack" (which he will show us)
            - "...lecturing while playing this game is hard, but don't worry; 
            I've been practicing all day"
            - Really, though, indie developers do this mostly to save effort on 
            designing the game; small studios can't afford dozens of level 
            designers, so they create algorithms to do it for them

- In early games, procedural generation was SUPER popular, then it almost died 
off with the rise of larger studios, and now it's come roaring back in the past 
10 years or so
    - The "traditional" game design model is where non-technical designers come 
    up with what they want, hand it off the programmers, and the programmers 
    make it interactive; this process is repeated iteratively, ad infinitum
    - Nowadays, though, programmers have a LOT more power: they create the 
    engines, build tools to help the designer, and then designers use the tools 
    to create things, and then developers help refine them (ad infinitum)

- Level generation was pretty prominent in the early days of games, spurred on 
by a lack of professional designers and the limited storage space of most 
computers (the more you could generate on the fly, the less you have to store))
    - For dealing with random numbers, we could either use a different seed 
    every time we play the game (based on the clock or something like that), or 
    specify the seed we want so we get the same content every time
        - Specifying the seed allows us to "store" levels by saving seed values
        - Hopefully, the algorithm is cheap enough that we could generate 
        everything we need on the fly
    - As storage space got cheaper and cheaper, game designers worried less and 
    less about this, and it got more and more common to just hire designers to 
    do everything

- The take-away message here is that content is KING: it's why people come back 
to games, and it's the domain of the designer
    - Sometimes new innovations result in entirely new genres, but really, 
    we've mostly been playing the same basic games since the 1990s with updated 
    content
    - With PCG, then, we can get content without needing everything to go 
    through the headspace of a human designer; what does that get us?
        - Cost savings compared to hiring more designers
        - Improved replayability (no one'll watch the same movie endlessly 
        without getting bored, but PCG can )
        - Customization and adaptation in your game (the experience can be 
        tailored for YOU specifically, e.g. difficulty adjustment)
        - Dynamically adapting the difficulty
            - If you've ever heard of "Flow" theory, there's a graph with 2 
            axes - "skill" and "difficulty" - and humans operate best in the 
            "zone of proximal development," where they're doing something that 
            matches their skill level
                - If the difficulty is too low compared with their skill, 
                people get bored; if it's too difficult, they get frustrated
                - This is made more complicated by the fact that skill isn't a 
                constant; people can get better/worse at doing something
            - Traditionally, games ask players to decide their own skill level 
            in advance before they've ever played the game

- Nowadays, there are two big ways we use PCG in games:
    - DESIGN-TIME algorithms that speed up the design process of our game and 
    help the designers
        - Constructing new 3D models and assets, for instance, is the most time 
        consuming part of game development by a good margin; we use the same 
        game engine, just with different pieces of content
        - To make all this content requires hundreds of developers, so saving 
        costs by not hiring developers sounds GREAT!
            - ...but algorithms can be stupid and do things that aren't fun for 
            the player, so game designers don't want to let go of the wheel
            - No Man's Sky, famously, had this problem, where there could be 10 
            boring planets in a row; version 2 of the game actually toned the 
            PCG DOWN so that the player experience was more consistent
        - The 3 most common places where PCG is used today are all design-time 
        applications: designing trees, designing city buildings, and terrain 
        generation
            - Even movies are starting to get in on the terrain generation, 
            since it saves quite a bit of time
            - The player, hopefully, will never realize these things weren't 
            designed by a human
    - RUN-TIME algorithms that actually change every time we run the game, e.g. 
    for customizing things dynamically, generating a new map each time, etc.

- All right, we'll start diving into the algorithms to actually start doing all 
this stuff on Wednesday!
