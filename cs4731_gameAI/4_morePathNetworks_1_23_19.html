//*************** Path Networks (cont.) - January 23rd, 2019 ****************//
//**************************************************************************//

- I seem to be approaching completion of the physics homework...alas, I have 
not reached the threshold of victory's gate as yet
- Also, Riedl has nearly killed us with microphone squeals. All the pain.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Okay, today we're going to be talking about automatic path networks: we want 
to take a map we don't know stuff about, figure out where to put the path 
networks, and then connect them all up
    - "I've posted a tutorial covering some of this on Piazza, so please use 
    that as a reference!"
- Sadly, this is something that SOUNDS really simple, but that actually has 
many, many pitfalls for you to discover
    - They're also kind of a pain to debug, so there's a utility that lets you 
    click on your navmesh stuff to highlight the polygons

- Right: PATH NODE PLACEMENT!
    - As we said last time (forever-ago), many games choose to have designers 
    put down the pathnodes manually, but placing them automatically can save 
    time during the design phase
        - Placing the nodes automatically also lets you put path networks in 
        dynamic environments

- To do this, we'll go over a version of the path node algorithm: the "greedy 
navmesh algorithm"

- First up, though: what IS a navigation mesh?
    - Well, it's "a set of convex polygons such that each polygon is an 
    unobstructed space"
        - And remember, a convex polygon is one where the (exterior) angle 
        between any 3 points is greater than 180 degrees
        - "This is really useful, since it means that we can go anywhere inside 
        the polygon without encountering any obstacles, as well as travel to 
        adjacent convex polygons"
- So, convex polygons are our friends, but how do we create them? Well, here's 
the GREEDY NAVMESH ALGORITHM to do it
    - Here's what we're going to do:
        1) Find a triangle
            - "Triangles are lovely - they're always convex, and they're the 
            simplest shape"
            - To do THIS, we'll randomly pick a starting point on some obstacle
            - From there, we'll find 2 SUCCESSOR points such that they are 
            successors of each other
                - For our purposes here, a "successor" is any point we find by 
                either moving along the edge of the obstacle, or by moving 
                through "freespace" (i.e. we can draw a straight line to it)
                - By "successors of each other," we mean that the starting 
                point can see the successor, and the successor can see the 
                starting point
            - And with that, we have 3 points - bingo! We've found a triangle!
        2) Find a second triangle, from that same starting point
            - We do this using the same algorithm as last time
            - "But how do we avoid overlapping triangles?" Ideally, the 
            triangle we created should block our raycasts from the start point  
            - "Anytime you make a new triangle, just pretend you made a new 
            obstacle"
                - ...annoyingly, this means You can't save the successors you 
                found. For this algorithm, you have to find them from scratch 
                for each step
            - Another edge case: how do we avoid creating a BIG triangle that 
            has an obstacle inside? Or another triangle?
                - (my current idea: somehow check that there are no points 
                inside our triangle?)
                - ...you'll find out there's a lot of these edge cases in the 
                homework
        3) Continue finding triangles until we can't make any more new ones 
        from our starting point
        4) Pick a new starting point; go back to 2/3 for this new point
        5) Continue until we've tried to use every obstacle point as a starting 
        point
    - After we run this (assuming we handled all the edge cases correctly), 
    every single free space should be filled in with a triangle! Cool!
    
- ...buuuuuut this algorithm tends to create a LOT of small triangles, which is 
less efficient for our algorithm
    - So what'll we do? We MERGE our triangles!
        - So, we'll look for any 2 adjacent triangles, check if the resulting 
        merger is still convex, and if so, merge it!
            - "I think I gave you a function to check concavity, but really, 
            you just walk around the edges and check their angles"
        - From there, we can merge a triangle onto ANY other convex shape, so 
        we just keep doing that - for any shape, we check the adjacent 
        triangles, then merge
    - One thing to keep track of: make sure your newly-merged polygons preserve 
    the ORDER of your points
        - If you mess up the order, it'll be drawn incorrectly and "twist", and 
        that's no fun (for you or the autograder)

- So, that's part 1 of this homework: we've created our navmesh, and hopefully 
it's all stitched together nicely (don't worry, it'll probably be a mess anyway)

- NOW, we've got to determine where we're actually putting our path nodes
    - Because these shapes are convex, we can use them to our advantage - but 
    there are MULTIPLE ways of placing these down, all of them valid (well, if 
    you do them correctly)
        - "So, I'll list some of the options, and then you get to decide"
    - OPTION #1 - Place a waypoint in the center of every convex polygon
        - This is simple, but it's NOT guaranteed to give you a fully connected 
        path network, since it's possible for the points to be put too close to 
        an obstacle if the navmesh is a skinny triangle
        - So, if you're dealing with weird spaces (*cough* your homework), this 
        might not be the best option
    - OPTION #2 - Place a waypoint between the edges of adjacent navmesh 
    polygons
        - Because these are convex polygons, we KNOW we can move to these 
        points, so the graph'll be fully connected!
            - "You CAN still end up too close to obstacles here, but you'll 
            usually have other options to move around them"
        - The issue, though, is that this tends to create more points/paths to 
        search through, which can slow down your actual search algorithms
    - OPTION #3 - Put waypoints at the corners of obstacles!
        - This will lead to the agent hugging the corners of obstacles (much 
        like Freshman Jake)
        - The difficulty here is that you have to offset your waypoints from 
        the corners, so your agent doesn't try to actually run inside the 
        obstacle
    - OPTION #4 - Hybrid schemes
        - For instance, you can do corners AND edges - "this'll lead to a LOT 
        of lines in your path network"
        - Center and edges is Professor Riedl's favorite - "this is a good mix 
        between giving you plenty of options, and not creating too many points"
- In general, you want the simplest path network that's still fully connected, 
striking a balance between your agent being able to reach everywhere and your 
search algorithms still being performant

- So, that's that - solutions up to about O(N^4) should still run in just a few 
seconds, but any more than that and it'll start to be strained

- Now, this is all well and good for a static environment, but this is 2019 
we're talking about (this statement will sound very outdated pretty soon) - 
games are dynamic with explodey and breaky things! How can we deal with this?
    - Well, if our environment is drastically changing in ways we can't predict 
    until runtime, we have to start worrying about REPATHING: 
        - Say, for instance, that a giant boulder falls down onto our navmesh - 
        now the agent's assumption they can move anywhere on the mesh without 
        obstruction isn't true!
        - To deal with this, we'll re-run our navmesh generator INSIDE the 
        affected polygon, rebuilding the mesh around the obstacle so that our 
        agent now knows how to get around the obstacle
            - The hope is that this is a fairly small polygon, so we can run 
            the algorithm pretty quickly, even at runtime
    - "I don't know of many games that're actually dynamic in this way - it's 
    not that we can't do it, it's just that it's a whole new can of development 
    worms to deal with, and most games don't need it"

- Alright - you've got the goods to do your homework now, so go forth! We'll 
meet again next week!
