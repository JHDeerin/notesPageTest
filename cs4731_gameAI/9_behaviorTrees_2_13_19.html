//****************** Behavior Trees - February 13th, 2019 *******************//
//**************************************************************************//

- It was a bright cold day in February, and the calendars were marked 13...
- Fun story: it turns out Professor Riedl's microphone broadcasts at the same 
frequency as the 3rd floor lecture hall, which means that every now and again 
they'll hear the ghostly sounds of an unembodied Professor, talking...

- Also: EXAM 1!
    - The first exam has been pushed back to February 25th; if this ends up 
    being an issue due to travel plans, etc., PLEASE come talk to me!
- In the meantime, let's start looking at Homework 5
    - With this homework, we'll start putting decision-making into the agent 
    using FSMs so that it can play a simple capture-the-flag style MOBA game
        - Normally in a MOBA, each team will have one or more hero characters, 
        along with a few minions who'll go straight towards the base and start 
        attacking it
            - You'll be implementing the minions - once again, the gates'll 
            screw everything up, so you'll need to use your homework 4 solution 
            for pathfinding. You'll have to have the agents destroy all the 
            towers FIRST before they attack the main base
    - There'll be a naive 'BaselineMinion' agent for you to test your solution 
    against
    - To make sure you're doing a decent job, you'll have to use no more than 
    60 agents to destroy the base, and defeat the baseline agents 3/3 times 
    over 3 games, to get a full score
        - There'll be several different maps, so you can't just hardcode 
        scripted strategies in
        - There's no friendly fire, so you don't need to worry about that
        - One last thing to know: if minions are inside a tower, they take 
        damage, so you can't just have them hide inside the tower and cheat 
        (this was an, um, "popular" solution last semester)
    - To run this, you'll be using the "py -2 runmobacompetition BaselineMinion 
    MyMinion" command
- "The hard part of this assignment isn't creating the FSM, but creating it in 
a way that works well with the game engine"

- (My initial idea: 'save up' minions for defense on my side until I have ~20 
or so, and then send 10 of them over at once)
    - (According to Professor Riedl, though, people have figured out how to 
    take down a base with just 3 minions in previous semesters (unsure how - 
    maybe by dodging the tower shots?))
---------------------------------------------------------

- Annnnnnnnyways, we were talking about behavior trees last time: a way of 
specifying sequences of actions "in context," by creating a decision tree 
style...tree, which leads to an action that (hopefully, based on the decision 
nodes) is appropriate for the given task
    - In HALO, for example, there are very weak enemies called "Grunts" who 
    flock together and get more organized when a Commander enemy is nearby, but 
    are less effective o their own. In the actual game, their decision tree 
    probably has like 1000 nodes in it; I'll give you the ~12-node pared-down 
    version:
        - The priority list nodes are ordered left-to-right, with the 
        highest-priority action on the left

                            [PL(Root)]
                                |
                                |
            -------------------------------------------
            |                   |                     |
        (force&lt;50%)         (playerVisible)           |
            |                   |                     |
     [SEQ(Retreat)]         [PL(Attack)]         [SEQ(Patrol)]
            |                   |                     |
    -----------------      ---------------           (...)
    |       |       |      |             |
[Panic] [MoveAway] [PL]  (hasCommander) [SEQ]
                    |      |             
                  (...)  [SEQ]
                           |
                         (...)

    - Now, we CAN do everything we can do with behavior trees using just FSMs 
    (they're Turing complete, after all), but it's a LOT easier to create 
    sequences of actions with Behavior Trees. It's like going from Assembly to 
    C++ for decision making structures
        - You'll have a chance to design your own behavior trees for homework 6 
        - wait, what's that? You don't know how to make them? Let's fix that!

- If you go online, you can find PLENTY of pseudocode for behavior trees, but 
most of it is simplified to the point of being unusable. Let's try and run 
through a few things you'll need to have:
    - ACTIONS are the actual things we want our agent to be able to do, and 
    will make up the leaves of the tree
        - The code for them will look something like this (we return false if 
        the action wasn't fully completed):

            Class Action(Node):
                def run():
                    if (can't perform action for some reason):
                        return False
                    (...do whatever we need to do...)
                    return True or False

    - PRIORITY LIST is a selector node that'll just execute the first action it 
    can, and only that one
        - The code'll look like:

            Class PriorityList(Node):
                childrenNodes = []
                def run():
                    for child in childrenNodes:
                        if child.run() == True:
                            return True
                    return False (if we couldn't execute any children)

        - "So, we try to execute any child we can...and to be clear, no kids 
        were harmed in the making of this slide, folks"

    - SEQUENCES are like PLs, except we try to execute all our children and 
    return False if ANY of our children fail to run
        - Code-wise:

            Class Sequence(Node):
                childrenNodes = []
                def run():
                    for child in childrenNodes:
                        if child.run() == False:
                            return False
                    return True (if we executed all the children)

- There's a MASSIVE problem with this code, though. In a game engine, what'll 
this code for Sequence actually do?
    - Well, it'll try to execute an ENTIRE sequence of actions in a single 
    tick! We're telling the agent to move AND shoot AND duck AND jump AND turn, 
    ALL AT THE SAME INSTANT!
        - So, we need to modify this so our behavior trees know that time needs 
        to pass: that we only want to execute one action per tick, and that 
        that action might take multiple ticks to complete
    - At a high level, here's what we can do to fix this:
        - Each PL and Sequence node will keep a pointer to a single child node 
        - the "currently executing" node
        - Each tick, if we end up at the node with the pointer, we first follow 
        this pointer down to the leaf and ONLY execute this one action; next 
        tick, we start at the root again
            - If the current action is STILL around, we'll just go straight 
            back to that action again until we're done with it, then clear the 
            pointer
            - Let's add a 3rd return option for the actions, then: if the 
            action returns NONE, that means "I'm still completing this action, 
            keep me around as the current action"
                - All the selector nodes should return "None" if their current 
                action returns None

- Sometimes, though, you'll need to interrupt a sequence early (e.g. if the 
player walks into a room, you don't want your agent to say 'hold on, I need to 
finish my patrol action first!')
    - To handle this, we'll add an INTERRUPT DAEMON: a special node with only 1 
    child, where if some condition is true it'll execute that child
    - So, for instance, we might put an interrupt node with a condition 
    "playerNotVisible" in-between the root and the "patrol" sequence node
        - This allows us to short-circuit certain actions if we need to - which 
        is great!
        - Most commonly, you'll be short-circuiting sequence nodes to stop 
        sequences if a plan is no longer relevant

- Rarely, we might also want SHORTCUTS that allow us to jump from one subtree 
to another subtree
    - This allows for code reuse, which is great! It also has another name: 
    SPAGHETTI PROGRAMMING!
        - If you use this all over the place, your tree will become a DAG 
        instead, which is a MESS to deal with - in general, using shortcuts for 
        behavior trees isn't the greatest idea if you can avoid it

- Okay, that's some implementation stuff - but what're the advantages of these 
behavior trees?
    - First off, the appearance of goal driven behavior
        - The agent is really only doing decision-making in the priority lists, 
        and all those decisions are very simple - but because of how the tree 
        is structured, it still allows us to give the illusion of structure and 
        order in how the agent reacts
    - Multi-step behavior
        - This was hard to do in FSMs, but in behavior trees, it's 
        comparatively easy thanks to our sequence nodes
    - Fast performance
        - We can run this every single tick, since actions that take multiple 
        ticks should be handled with the right implementation
    - Recovery from errors
        - Using our interrupt nodes, we can quickly replan if the situation 
        changes (which is great, since the player is basically an agent of 
        chaos)
- Why WOULDN'T we want to use these sorts of trees, though?
    - The agent isn't ACTUALLY thinking, it's just following recipes - and the 
    players can learn these sequences
    - The behavior is still only as good as the designer makes it - if you 
    design the tree stupidly, your agents will act stupidly

- So, behavior trees allow a *little* bit of decision making on the agent's 
part, but what can a REAL AI planner do?
    - Keep in mind that having a full-blown AI system is a tradeoff: we have to 
    do less hard-coding, but as the designer, we're losing a lot of control 
    over the agent
- One fancy thing we can do, though, is handle decision making with a RULE 
SYSTEM (or "production system")
    - This is a form of reactive planning where we have a bunch of 
    "IF...THEN..." style rules about the world
        - Here, we'll have bunch of "facts" that the agent knows about the 
        world ('I have a gun,' 'The leader is here,' etc), and some rules for 
        what to do (IF player visible, THEN IF hasGun, THEN fireGun)
        - We match our known list of facts to our rules using pattern matching
    - If a rule could be applied to the current known state of the world, then 
    we say that rule is now "activated" (i.e. ready-to-run)
        - Every tick, we choose one of the active rules to use (somehow), take 
        that action, update the agent's knowledge based on how the world has 
        changed, and repeat
        - "It's like writing a program, and then allowing the computer to 
        decide which functions to call and when - which allows the agent to 
        automate a lot of things, but means we lose a good amount of control 
        over the experience"

- Where are rule engines actually used? Well, for one example, Valve's TF2 and 
Left 4 Dead games use rule engines to handle banter between characters ('That 
medic is a spy!', 'Nein, mein Freund!')!

- We'll dive into the details of how rule systems are actually implemented, and 
the algorithms they use, next week! See y'all then!
