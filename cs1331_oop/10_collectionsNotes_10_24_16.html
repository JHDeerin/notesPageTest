//*********Java Collections - October 24th, 2016***********//
//********************************************************//

-Something you apparently learn in the Air Force: we have "predator eyes" 
specially adapted to detect movement, even if we only see it in the corner of 
our sight, and focus our attention on moving things if we see them; the moral? 
TURN OFF YOUR DISTRACTING DOODADS
-"I love all blocks of this course equally- but this one's my favorite" -Prof. 
Simpkins 2016
-----------------------------------------

-We're getting to finally start putting the pieces together and answer the 
question: what is all this OOP for?
-Example: Exceptions are ENTIRELY defined in the standard library using the 
concepts we already learned
-The objects framework is no different; HEAVILY reliant on polymorphism, as we 
will see

-A COLLECTION is just an object that represents a collection of other objects
    -Our previous classes were AGRAGATIONS; collections are COMPOSITIONS
-By default, the "Collection" class is actually an interface, with 
sub-interfaces extending that interface (e.g. "interface Set extends 
Collection")

-The Java Collections Framework consists of:
    -Collection interfaces representing types of collections
    -CONCRETE, general purpose implementations of those interfaces
    -Abstract implementations meant to be built upon by the user (yet another 
    real-world example of interfaces/abstract being useful)
    -A set of algorithms that are defined as "utility methods" to be called on 
    collections
    -"Infrastructure Interfaces", like Comparable or Iterator, that support all 
    of these

-Collection interface itself contains basic operations, e.g. "add, contains, 
etc."
-LIST interface extends Collection to represent a SEQUENTIAL, ORDERED 
collection of objects (fundamental property of lists)
    -Three IMPORTANT implementations: "ArrayList" (our go-to class), 
    "LinkedList" (get to it later), and "Vector" (slowly being phased out)
    -Contains some additional methods, e.g. Sublist

-Remember, an ArrayList can be declared like any other class, elements added 
via .add(), and accessed via "indexed access" (i.e. the array [n] syntax)

-RAW LIST; when the ArrayList is NOT given a type upon being instantiated; this 
will make the compiler throw a warning
    -Will get the "unsafe operations" or "unchecked operations" warning, since 
    they're "technically" typechecked, but only as Object
    -ALL of the objects in the array will be of type "Object"; means we have to 
    cast the object EVERY time we want to use a non-Object method on it
    -Means we CANNOT put primitives into an ArrayList (unless you use a Wrapper 
    class... which we'll get to)
-This is dangerous, because we can add multiple types of wildly different 
objects to our list
    -Not only is this disorganized, but can result in casting exceptions, etc.

-Before Java 1.5, we handled this just by casting everything; there wasn't a 
better way!
    -Like we said, this is REALLY, REALLY error prone!!!

-Instead, we now can declare "List&lt;E&gt; =", where &lt;E&gt; is a TYPE PARAMETER that 
will limit what we can put in (just like an array!)
    -Java does this using something called GENERICS, where the "E" means that 
    any type that inherits from object can go there

example: "ArrayList&lt;Strings&gt; strings = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();" //java will infer 
what type goes in the angle brackets if you leave them blank in the 2nd one 
ONLY; can still put the type in and it will compile just fine, though
    -Works because Java doesn't jave "Reified type checking"

-Now, what if we want to use primitives though? Well, we have to "wrap" (or 
"box") the primitive in a WRAPPER class that will contain the primitives and 
let them be used with generics; e.g.:
    -ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; ints = new Arraylist&lt;&gt;();

-So, when we ADD a integer primitive, Java will "autobox" the integer and 
convert it into a Integer
    -HOWEVER, this means we can't just say "int i = ints[0]", since all of the 
    entries ARE NOT "int"s; they're "Integer" objects!...
    -...IF the array is UNTYPED;
    -If the array IS typed with an &lt;Integer&gt;, then Java 7+ became smart enough 
    to handle autounboxing; hurrah!

-Another collection is a SET; the essential property of a set is that there are 
NO DUPLICATES (e.g. {a a a a a b b b} = {a b}), ANd that the Set doesn't have 
to be in a set order

-A "Map&lt;k, v&gt;" (also known as a "dictionary" in Python) is an object htat maps 
"keys" (the V) to a particular, unique value (v)
    -added via "put", retrieved via "get()"

-ASSIGNMENT: Write a class "WordCount" that takes in a String "fileName" as a 
constructor and counts how many times a certain word appears in the file
    -File supplied is on the GitHub for the class, but you can use any file 
    you'd like
    -What do you think you'll use? ...if you said a "Map", good! :D
