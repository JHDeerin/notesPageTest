//****** Polymorphism (cont.) - October 3rd, 2016 ********//
//*******************************************************//

-World Ballet Day tomorrow! Hence the random "Giselle" appearance (also the 
ballet deals w/ ghosts, and it's October, sooooooo...)
-"Yes, I said innovative, so you can all mark the squares on your BS bingo 
cards"- Simpkins 2016
-Problems w/ 1st homework? See us- we'll try to figure it out and help you as 
best we can. In particular, you WILL get points if you did actually turn them in
-Tests will be handed back at recitation tomorrow; all regrade requests must be 
made within 1 WEEK of getting your test back
    -Average was ~78%, which is "typical good" for this class
    -Programming quizzes are still being worked through, but grade should match 
    what you received via the auto grader
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-RIGHT, so we've been playing w/ polymorphism via the "Employee" class and the 
"monthlyPay" method- it was declared in the Super class but implemented in the 
subclass
    -If method is abstract, child class MUST write its own implementation 
    unless it is also an abstract class
    -In UML, abstracts are written in italics (not tested, but good to know)
-Polymorphism works via dynamic types overriding "static" types of element (at 
runtime, compile-time "static-type" "Employee" replaced w/ child classes in the 
array), allowing us to call the same method on multiple types, even though the 
subclasses are different and their implementations are different
    -Method must be on actual parent "Employee" class
-Typecasting a child class to the super class will STILL result in the child 
class's methods being used

-Let's say we have two methods w/ the same name and the EXACT same code in 2 
different child classes. How can we avoid the duplicated code?
    -Could put the code in the parent class, but if it's a private method that 
    won't work; so instead, we use the "protected" keyword
        -PROTECTED allows child classes AND members of the same package to see 
        the variable/ method
    -Protected...*works*, and can be useful in places, but it can be a bit 
    messy and can easily be abused. There's a better way...but we'll get to 
    that later

-ENUMS!
-Enums allow for the easy creation of "mini-classes", e.g.
    "public enum Month{Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, 
    Dec}"
    -This defines an Enum called "Month" that can ONLY take the predefined 
    constants Month.Jan, Month.Feb,...etc.
        -Enums are a type of class, and are typechecked at compile time
        -Java has some built-in methods for Enums; because they are technically 
        classes, programmer's can do some cool stuff with them (define 
        constructors, etc.)
        -For now, very nice for defining a set list of unchanging objects

-We can overload methods so that there are 2 methods with the same name, but 
different inputs/signatures/parameter lists; Java is smart enough to figure out 
which one we want to use.
    -e.g. Could choose to pay either by a number of hours, or by a certain month
    -Technically, any two methods with the same name but whose declarations are 
    not "override equivalent" are overloaded

-Ad-Hoc Polymorphism: Overload submethods
-Parametric Polymporphism: Will learn this later
-Subtype polymorphism: Override parent's methods

Inheritance Problems
-So, we have the "disallowZeroes&amp;Negatives" method in the parent "Employee" 
class...but this is a more general concept than just belonging to "Employees," 
but only Employee subclasses can use it
    -We say that this method makes the class lack COHESION, as the "Employees" 
    class now has a part that conceptually doesn't need to be there
-So, we instead move this method to a new "ValidationUtils" class and make the 
methods static, so ANY class can use this method by calling 
"ValidationUtils.disallowZeroes&amp;Negatives"
    -This is fine since this method doesn't depend on the caller's "state"; in 
    contrast, a "getName" method can't be in a separate class like tihs, since 
    it needs information from the class

Implementation inheritance vs Interface inheritance
-FAVOR INTERFACE INHERITANCE- allows for a "loose-coupling" apporach where more 
code can be reused

Good Design Principles:
-Single Responsibility- module should only contain code that is related to its 
definition; e.g. "Employee" shouldn't have a method like "hoistAnchor" (too 
specific) or "addNumber" (too general)

-Open-Closed Principle- can write new code without having to modify old code to 
make it work

-Liskov substitution principle- we'll focus on that later

-SO, for next class:
    -Check slides for Animal Programming Exercise; do everything up until the 
    Kennel class

-Can do "intentional programing"- write client code first, then implement the 
methods to make it work
