//**********Stacks &amp; Queues - December 2nd, 2016************//
//*********************************************************//

-...annnnnnnnnd Simpkins is back!
    -Sleep-deprived due to thesis preparation, but back!
-Grade average for the class is 82% right now, which is higher than exepected
-Monday will just be review for the exam; bring your questions!
-Good way to study for final: look at your past exams!
    -basically copy-pasting previous questions w/ minor changes (e.g. coding a 
    for loop instead of a while loop, etc.)
-----------------------------------------------

-Right! Stacks!
-What kind of stacks? Pancake stacks?
    -No, it's a data structure (which is more useful, but slightly less tasty)
    -Name originally comes from "stacks" of plates in cafeterias, as they 
    operate in basically the same way
-The stack is a LIFO data structure - "Last in, first out"
-Operates basically like...well, a stack
    -2 Key operations: "push" and "pop"!
        -PUSH: puts a new element on the stack
        -POP: removes and returns the most recently "pushed" data
            -Basically, this removes the "head" of the list and assigns the 
            head to the new "top" of the stack (the 2nd element in the list, if 
            you're using LinkedLists)
            -Most usually also have a "peek" method that returns (but does not 
            remove) the top element, and an "isEmpty()" check

-VERY easy to implement using arrayLists
-Using Linked Lists, there's also a "Linked Stack" implementation; major 
difference is, when removing, you have to handle re-assigning the head when 
popping something off the stack

"LinkedStack myStack = new LinkedStack();
myStack.push("a");"

    -Generates a new "head" "a", with a null "next" pointer

then, "myStack.push("b")"
    -Now, "b"'s "next" pointer = "a", and "b" becomes the new "head"

(Minor Simpkins screw-up when drawing this in a diagram
    -"The squiggly line is formal language for 'erased'" - Simpkins 2016)

"x = myStack.pop();"
    -"head" (b) is first re-assigned to "a", then "b" is removed from the list 
    and stored in x
    -SIDE NOTE: if we stop here, then X(?) would get garbage collected, since 
    nothing is referring to it
        -In languages w/o garbage collection, not noticing stuff like this is 
        what results in "memory leaks"...which you'll probably cause in 2110

-A QUEUE, on the other hand, is a FIFO - "First in, first out" - data structure 
with two methods:
    -Way to remember spelling - "KYOO-EY-OO-EY". Ta-da
    -enqueque: adds element to the end of the list
    -dequeque: removes element at the beginning of the list
        -Very similarly to LinkedStacks, there's a implementation for this via 
        linkedlists - there's just, in addition to a head,

-HOWEVER, if we use the ArrayList operation to pop() something from a stack, it 
takes O(n) time
    -NOT because we have to iterate through the list to find th head (we still 
    find it right away), but because AFTER removing that element, we have to 
    shift EVERY element in the array one place to the left
-How long does it take for a LinkedList implementation? O(1) !!!!
    -NO MATTER HOW BIG THE LIST, it only takes two steps - removing the 
    element, and re-assigning the head variable
    -This is in CONSTANT TIME - which, if you learn ANYTHING about algorithms, 
    is AWESOME
        -...and, for some applications, essential
-Same principle applies for Queues as well

-So, IMPLEMENTATION MATTERS
    -Also, you just learned an ACTUAL use for LinkedLists
        -"Why would I use a linkedList when I have an ArrayList?" Because 
        LinkedLists do have ACTUAL ADVANTAGES over ArrayLists - we teach these 
        things because they're actually useful, not just to torture you

-Theoretically, our implementations follow all the core principles of these 
data structures; BUT, from an OOP standpoint, there are a few design issues
    -Calling "Pop" on an empty stack...:
        -ArrayLisy:"ArrayIndexOutOfBounds"; tries to access "length-1" element, 
        so when we try it on a 0-length list, it tries to access a negative 
        element and explodes
        -LinkedList: "NullPointerException"; tries to get the "next" element 
        from a head that doesn't exist any more

-This is a problem, for two reasons:
    -It gives implementation details to the user, cluttering the error report 
    and violating abstraction
    -MORE IMPORTANTLY, if someone else uses this function (e.g. in a library), 
    they'll see the error with OUR implementation, and NOT the fundamental 
    ERROR THEY MADE: trying to access elements from an empty stack

-So, we change this by having our implementation throw a runtime 
"EmptyStackException" (conveniently in the JSL (Java Standard Library))
    -SIDE NOTE: Instead of importing things, can use the "fully qualified 
    classname" of calling something (e.g. "int = java.util.Random.nextInt()")
        -Can be useful if there are multiple classes with the same name (e.g. 
        you have your own custom "EmptyStackException", but also want to use 
        Java's implementation elsewhere in the class)
-The PROBLEM with this is that since Java's implementation is a 
RuntimeException, classes won't be required to catch the error - leading to 
crashes that the user doesn't understand the reason for (without digging 
through the error report)

-So, we'll fix THAT by creating an Abstract class that handles catching the 
error ourselves
    -Implementation in slides has an example of this using Abstract classes / 
    interfaces together

-Programming Exercise in slides - We'll go over it in next lecture, so try it 
out!
    -For those curious, pseudocode for that excercise is written in LISP
    -For the first one, oyu don't need a stack; for the 2nd, you do
        -First one: INITIAL HEURISTIc is to count # of open / closing 
        parentheses and see if they're equal, BUT doesn't catch the case of if 
        there's a closing before an open (e.g. ")()")
            -So, we fix this by counting ALONG THE WAY, adding 1 for every open 
            and subtracting for every closed - if we ever get to a negative # 
            OR aren't at zero by the end, parentheses are unbalanced
