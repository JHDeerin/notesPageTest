//*************Inheritance - September 26th, 2016********//
//******************************************************//

-Side note: Cobb County School Board is apparently silly
-Towards the end of the year, there'll be extra points available, as some 
people need a "catch-up" period to really grasp programming concepts; the 
system is designed to be student friendly. Practical result: don't stress out 
too much about the first exam.
-For the programming quiz, just remember: you don't have to code it on paper.
-For programming interviews: it's expensive to screw up hiring, which is why 
selection is so rigorous. So you'll usually have to do a coding portion (often 
via pair programming, which we would've done if there were enough TAs). 
Usually, it's not the "n-queens" problem or anything mightily hard (although 
sometimes they are); usually they're looking to see if you can take, interpret, 
and solve an intermediate-level problem as efficiently as possible without 
major screw-ups or constant guidance
-Side note from Professor Simpkins: It's awesome to work at GT w/ GT students, 
but while I'm wrapping up my Phd. I need a lot of work. So if I can't talk for 
very long or seem stressed, it's not your fault. Usually.

-HOMEWORK: 2 is more open ended than 1, and that trend WILL continue. These 
homeworks are testing your design skills as well as your coding skills. That 
being said: READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. These are free points if you know what they 
are; if you miss them, though, those are free points lost, and irl could mean 
annoying a client or accidentally introducing a safety hazard, so READ 
CAREFULLY.
    -Later on, in classes and in industry, you'll often have to take a problem 
    and make your own instructions out of it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Probably, you already knew almost everything we did before (maybe in a 
different language). Inheritance will still be old hat for some of you, but 
it's the first really "new" thing for most people.
-Java has a lot of boilerplate and some annoying stuff, but it is a GREAT 
language for LARGE projects. Some of the stuff that seems annoying here because 
of the small projects we do turn into life-savers on real, complex software 
systems.
-We can deal with complexity via ABSTRACTION (hiding irrelevant details), 
DECOMPOSITION(decomposing into classes, functions, packages, etc) and REUSE
-Inheritance combines all 3 of these

-INHERITANCE is just deriving one class from another class
    -Classes that inherit from another class are a "subclass" or "derived 
    class" or "child class"
IMPORTANT: Inheritance IS NOT ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION REUSE. Instead, it is about 
resusing CONCEPTS. e.g. "HourlyEmployee" is-a "Employee"

-Pretend we have an employee class that has members and methods for "name", 
"dateOfHire", etc.
-We can create a brand new class that EXTENDS the "Employee" class, e.g.
    "public class HourlyEmployee extend Employee"
-HourlyEmployee inherits all members/methods from Employee, but can't directly 
access private methods/members
-Can use the "super" call to reuse the initial constructor

(GOTO HourlyEmployee class)

-When inheriting, you are extending the capabilities the class already had

-When considering visibility modifier, there are levels for Classes, 
subclasses, packages, and the whole program; and public, protected, private, 
and no modifier modifiers; the table of what can view what is on the website, 
but private variables are only visible within the class
