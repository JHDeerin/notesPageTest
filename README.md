# Jake's CS Notes

[*View the nice(ish), rendered, online version of these notes*](https://jhdeerin.github.io/notesPageTest)

As a Computer Science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I have to
take a rather large number of classes. And what's the natural byproduct of all
classes? Notes. Lots and lots of notes that get taken down, studied for the
final, and then blissfully forgotten (usually halfway through said final).

In an effort to backup these notes for safekeeping, I'm steadily uploading what
electronic notes I have onto this webpage. Crazy CS-person that I am, I think
it's a fun project, and who knows? Maybe some other people will get some use out
of these scribblings - if nothing else, I know they've been useful to me.

*OBVIOUS DISCLAIMER: While I've striven to make these notes as accurate as 
possible (it's my grade too, after all), these are still just personal notes,
taken under pressure, and not official reference guides. You may find factual
errors, unfunny jokes, and long stretches of boring text scattered throughout.
Any opinions expressed herein are solely my own, and do not represent my school
or teachers in any way; any quotations within are paraphrases at best and may
not accurately represent what was said. Read at your own risk.*
