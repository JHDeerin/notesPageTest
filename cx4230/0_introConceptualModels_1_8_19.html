//*********** Introduction / Conceptual Models- January 8th, 2019 ***********//
//**************************************************************************//

- Okay, there's a lot of people in here for a 65 person class...am I in the 
wrong room?
- ...nope, I don't think it's...OH, okay
    - This class is cross-listed with a graduate ECE course (which, apparently, 
    every ECE major in the world is taking)
------------------------------------------------------------

- Okay, this class will have not one, but TWO professors!
    - Professor Richard Vuduc will cover the first part of the course, while 
    Professor Richard Fujimora will cover most of the last half
- Today'll be a typical syllabus day: going over what this course'll teach, 
with any remaining time spent discussing "conceptual models" and some vocab
    - So, obviously, we'll start off with the vocab

- So...what's a model?
    - If you do a Google search, you'll see images of model airplanes, fashion 
    models, 3D modeling software, etc...
    - For our purposes, a MODEL is "a simplified representation of a system"
        - Keywords here - it's a REPRESENTATION of something else (real or 
        imagined), and it's SIMPLIFIED - if it wasn't, it'd be as complex as 
        the actual thing!
        - These models could be mathematical, verbal, conceptual, physical, etc.
- Really, you've been creating models in your head all your life - whenever you 
try to understand how something works, you've created a "mental model" of it in 
your head!
    - Similarly, the equations you learned in physics are a model of how things 
    behave in the physical world, the ideal gas law is a model of how particles 
    behave, and so on
- One annoying but very important thing about models, though: you can't *prove* 
a model is correct
    - What you CAN do is make observations of how the real thing behaves, and 
    then see if your model's predictions match up - but this isn't a formal 
    proof
        - Even if we ran the model for a hundred years and every prediction it 
        made matched up with reality, it's still possible that our model is 
        wrong in some way
    - You CAN disprove a model, however - if the model's results are wildly 
    off, it can't possibly be the real thing

- A COMPUTER SIMULATION, on the other hand, is "a computer program that uses 
computation to construct a representation of a model's behavior over time"
    - Based off of some categories in the defense industry, there's a 
    "simulation quadrant" of different types of simulation:

                        Real Machines       | Simulated Machines
                        -----------------------------------------
            Real People | Live (e.g. Training) | Virtual sims (flight, etc.)
            Sim. People |         ?            | Constructive Simulation

        - "?" could be hardward-in-the-loop systems, automated testing, etc.
- HOWEVER, these defense-era models are a little awkward for our engineering 
and research purposes; instead, we have a taxonomy of different simulation 
types and models
    - A STOCHASTIC simulation is any simulation with random/probabilistic 
    elements
        - e.g. For a Starbucks customer sim, we might have a random probability 
        distribution for how many customers come in, how long it takes to serve 
        each, etc.
        - This could also mean that the output of the simulation is random and 
        unpredictable - a single run isn't enough to tell us everything (e.g. 
        you have to flip a coin many times to make inferences about its 
        probabilities)
    - DETERMINISTIC simulations, on the other hand, have no random elements - 
    they always give us the same output if we give them the same inputs
        - e.g. Simulating a digital circuit (same outputs for any given input), 
        chemical reaction, etc.
- "Hang on, professor - if we're modeling the real world, is the universe 
stochastic or probabilistic?" Welllll...
    - Typical events everyday seem pretty random - just look at a newsfeed!
    - On the other hand, the laws of physics seem pretty cut-and-dry and 
    deterministic (although, y'know, they are themselves models...)
        - Basically, WE DON'T KNOW ("does God play dice?", etc.); this is an 
        excellent philosophical conundrum
- Fortunately, we engineers don't have to know the true answer to this question 
to make useful models - we can choose whichever one seems most relevant to the 
problem at hand
    - Some relevant facts to keep in mind, though:
        - Random individual processes can lead to deterministic outcomes (e.g. 
        attractors)
        - Deterministic rules can still lead to almost random-seeming behavior 
        (e.g. chaos theory)

- Another way of categorizing simulations is Continuous vs discrete time
    - DISCRETE-time systems are ones where we view the state of the system only 
    at set points - we "jump" from one state to the next, with some transition 
    event to go between states
    - CONTINUOUS-time systems are where we view the state as smoothly changing 
    over time, and try to build the model to reflect this
        - Note that this is a conceptual distinction - at the computer level, 
        these both end up running as discrete programs, but the way these two 
        are implemented can be very different

- Another term you'll hear: "Complex/Adaptive systems"
    - These are systems composed of MANY interacting parts, e.g. stock markets, 
    flocks of animals, social networks, power grids, etc.
    - HOWEVER, just having many interacting components doesn't make a system 
    complex - what DOES is if the system exhibits some non-trivial emergent and 
    self-organizing behaviors, where they seems to follow some underlying 
    pattern even though no one's organizing these parts
        - Many of the real world systems we care about fall under this category

- Now, one last point before we go over the syllabus: is this stuff really 
still relevant? In the age of big data to analyze all this stuff, do we really 
need to simplify and simulate stuff? Do we really need these intermediate 
models?
    - Well, YES! Big data is important, machine learning is a great tool, but 
    it does NOT replace simulations
        - One major reason why is that correlation doesn't imply causation; 
        machine learning and data analysis let us infer correlation and some 
        likely outcomes for the system, but we don't know what CAUSES the 
        system to behave that way
            - Simulations, on the other hand, model the rules governing the 
            system, and let us examine what might be going on behind all this 
            data
        - Furthermore, if we don't have enough data to predict something, or if 
        we're trying to test new hypothetical scenarios, or if we want a deeper 
        understanding of the system itself, simple analysis won't do - we need 
        models
- To be clear, "big data"/data analysis and simulation aren't enemies - they're 
friends! They're synergistic, and don't replace each other!
    - Data analysis lets us characterize the inputs going into our models, and 
    it also helps us make inferences from our simulation results

- ...okay. With that, let's start going over the syllabus
    - We forgot to hit publish on Canvas - sorry! That'll be rectified as soon 
    as this class is over
- We have 4 beautiful, wonderful people serving as TAs - we'll post office 
hours so you can start runing their lives shortly
- The course itself is really about 2 components:
    - Understanding the elements/methodology of models and simulations
    - Understanding how to practically build and apply these simulations, run 
    them in parallel, etc.
        - Believe us, this stuff is best learned by doing
- As prerequisites, we assume...
    - You know how to program in some high-level language, like Python, Java, 
    C++, etc.
        - We'll let you choose which one! We're not picky!
    - Basic probability, calculus, linear algebra, and so on; we won't get very 
    complex with these, so if you're a little rusty, you should be able to pick 
    them back up pretty quick
- There'll be 3 different textbooks, which you DO NOT need to buy - one is 
available for free on the web, while the other is provided as an E-Book from 
the library
- Schedule-wise, the first half of the course will be focused more on 
continuous models, modeling approaches, and completing a large, overall project 
with a small team
    - "Since not having regular homeworks means most of you won't actually 
    learn anything, there'll be a midterm to check your knowledge late in 
    February"
    - The 2nd half is focused on discrete event simulation and actually 
    implementing the simulations efficiently and correctly
- Grading-wise, the 2 projects/project reports will each be worth 25% of your 
grade, and the 2 exams will be worth 25% of your grade each
    - No final exam, buuuuut...
- Collaboration-wise, all the code has to be your own team's work - you know 
the drill by now
- And that's the course!

- And with that out of the way, let's dive straight into our first big topic: 
conceptual models
    - First off: why is modeling/simulation hard?
        - Well, lots of reasons, but one of the hardest things is deciding what 
        to include in the model - and importantly, what NOT to include
            - As Einstein said, "Everything should be as simple as possible, 
            but no simpler" - but alas, it's easier said than done
    - To figure this out, you have to at least kinda know what you're going to 
    use the model for
- To do this, we first need to know what the actual system we're looking at is 
- the "SYSTEM UNDER INVESTIGATION" (SUI)
    - Eventually, we want to end up with the simulation program itself
    - ...and to get there, we'll create an intermediate CONCEPTUAL MODEL - a 
    simplified way of looking at the system
- One example to help illustrate this: traffic!
    - There's a lot of ways of looking at traffic; for instance, just a few of 
    the models that people actually use are:
        - A "fluid flow" model where you view cars and roads like a mass of 
        water flowing through a pipe
        - A cellular automata model, where each driver is seen as a box and we 
        model each driver's behavior 
        - A queueing model, where we view each lane of the road as a queue that 
        items are entering and being processed in
    - ALL of these are valid ways of looking at the system

- More concretely: A CONCEPTUAL MODEL is "an abstract representation of the 
system", specifying what should be included in the model, including:
    - Level of detail to include/"granularity"
    - What other abstractions might be used (queues, differential equations, 
    etc.)
    - Inputs/outputs we'll have, and the metrics they'll use
    - What assumptions/simplifications the model makes
    - What questions/objectives we care about answering with this model
- In contrast, the SIMUATION MODEL is the actual computer program we'll run at 
the end as our simulation
    - To repeat, a conceptual model is NOT the implementation, and is totally 
    separate from the code

- One important question this raises: does a more detailed model lead to a more 
accurate model?
    - Well, intuitively, we'd say yes - after all, the more stuff we have in 
    the simulation, the closer it is to the real deal, right?
    - HOWEVER, while higher detail might make the model more 
    credible/plausible, it will result in longer development times, greater 
    data requirements, and slower performance
        - ...and while greater detail CAN improve the accuracy, it also leada 
        to a higher chance of the model being WRONG as we add more detail - 
        especially if it turns out that some of those details really don't 
        matter very much for what we're looking at
        - Furthermore, the simpler the model is, the more likely we can 
        generalize it to work for other problems, too
- Basically, as we add more detail, we run into the problem of diminishing 
returns - we might only get a small increase in accuracy for a massive effort, 
and a lack of data or mistakes could lead to the model being inaccurate 
    - e.g. if we don't have data on how many truck drivers are on the road, or 
    how truck behavior differs from the average Chevy, adding trucks to our 
    simulation might just give us nonsense results that don't match up with the 
    real world
- So, in short: greater detail does NOT simply mean a more accurate model
    - "This doesn't mean we should never build complex models, of course - it 
    just means we should only build them if they're absolutely required"

- With any conceptual model, of course, there're some issues that need to be 
addressed; in particular, a good conceptual model needs to pass 4 tests:
    - Is the model VALID? Are its results similar to the real deal, or accurate 
    enough to tell us what we need?
    - Is the model CREDIBLE? Is it plausible enough to be believed by the 
    clients? (even if its predictions are correct, people might not trust a 
    model that doesn't seem 'convincingly real')
    - Is the model FEASIBLE? Do we have enough time and data to build it as 
    specified?
    - Is the model USEFUL? Is it easy to use, reasonably performant, does it 
    display data readably, and so on?
- In short, conceptual models are one of the most important - but also most 
difficult - parts of making a simulation. It's much more art than science, and 
it's easy to get wrong without realizing where you screwed up, but the whole 
rest of the simulation rests upon it.

- ...PHEW. So, we covered some basic vocabulary today and started getting into 
conceptual models. Next lecture, we'll go deeper into conceptual models, start 
going through specific examples, and more - see you then!
