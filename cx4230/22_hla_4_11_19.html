//*************** High-Level Architecture - April 11th, 2019 ****************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Alright, we're up to the last "real" topic we're going to cover in this class: taking simulations that've been developed separately and somehow getting them to work together
    - This is often done in a last-minute, ad-hoc way, but some serious effort has been spent on trying to do this systematically - in particular, via the "High-level architecture"
        - We'll spend a bit of the class talking about this problem in general, and then dive as deep as we can into HLA specifically - let's do it!

- Why, though, would we EVER want to tie two different simulations together?
    - Think about this example: suppose we're an urban planner, and we're trying to figure out how self-driving electric cars will affect quality-of-life factors in our neighborhood
        - One thing that might affect this is where people will live given this new transportation method, so we need a tool to look at how land use evolves over time (UrbanSim, PECASE, etc.)
        - We'll also want to know what that means for traffic, so we'll need some sort of traffic model
        - We might also want to know how this affects greenhouse gas emissions for our city, so that's another simulation we need (PowerWorld, environmental stuff, etc.)
            - ...and, of course, the list keeps going
    - There's been a LOT of work in all of these areas, so why start from scratch? Instead, it'd save us a LOT of time if we could reuse these existing simulations for our own use!
        - This problem, where we're interested in a "system-of-systems" that deals with multiple different, complex factors, comes up a LOT
            - It goes by a lot of different names ("federated simulations," "coupled simulations," etc.), but they all refer to this problem
        - It'd also be REALLY nice if this system could run in a distributed way, for performance and convenience reasons
    - How hard can this be, though? As it turns out, connecting 2 simulations is VERY difficult for a number of reasons:
        - Simulations tend to developed for different PROBLEM DEFINITIONS, and it's very likely that 2 different simulations are actually trying to solve 2 completely different problems w/ different scopes and scales
        - They likely use different conceptual models, making different assumptions, simplifications, and abstractions
        - The SIMULATION MODELS themselves probably represent their entities differently, use different ways of representing time progressing, etc.
        - And finally, having 2 separate, working simulators does NOT mean that their combined simulation is immediately verified and validated - we have to re-validate the whole thing again!

- As you can see, this is a VERY scary problem, and not all parts of it have been solved
    - When it comes to tying 2 different simulations together, there are actually different levels of integration they can have
        - The most basic level is INTEGRATEABILITY, where the physical computers themselves can talk to each other (use the same network protocols, compatible hardware, etc.)
            - By-and-large, this is a solved problem, although it was a major issue for many years and still comes up occasionally
        - Next up is INTEROPERABILITY, where we need to make sure the software programs themselves can talk to each other (use compatible APIs, consistent datatypes, etc.)
            - This is an even more difficult problem, but it can be solved by the programs using common libraries, compatible software architectures, etc.
        - Finally is the idea of COMPOSABILITY, where the simulation models themselves work together seamlessly (shared objectives and assumptions, common abstractions, etc.)
            - The goal here is for the models to be "composable" in the same way as mathematical functions, and this has proved notoriously difficult - very little progress has been made here

- One of the biggest attempts to tackle the 2nd "interoperability" program in the simulation world is the HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE standard
    - Why did this thing come about?
        - Well, back in the 1980s, the U.S. military had a problem: their computers were rife with STOVEPIPED SYSTEMS that couldn't communicate with one another and were only made for one specific use
            - This meant that existing software was hard to reuse for new tasks, and a lot of reinventing the wheel came about as a result - it was EXPENSIVE to build all these separate systems for similar tasks, and to have to re-build the systems every few years
    - To deal with this, the military wanted a common simulation infrastructure that would support the "interoperability and reuse of simulations" across the board
        - In particular, they cared about 3 categories of simulations that they wanted to work together:
            - ANALYTIC SIMULATIONS (e.g. doing "wargame" tests for different battle outcomes)
            - TRAINING SIMULATIONS (e.g. flight simulations, commander scenario training, etc.)
            - TEST/EVALUATION SIMULATIONS (e.g. testing hardware)
    - Because they figured it was impossible to build a single "megasimulation" that could handle all of these tasks at once, HLA was designed to promote simulations that would work together to create "systems of systems" with reusable pieces
        - The hope was that FEDERATIONS of individual simulations (or "federates") could be created that would all work together, with 4 main types of simulations:
            - CONSTRUCTIVE simulations are totally software, without any human intervention
            - HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP are software simulations with human inputs (e.g. flight simulators)
            - LIVE simulations involve outputs in the real world (e.g. blinking red light, hardware testing)
            - The holy grail is the LVC - "Live, Virtual, Constructive simulation" - that would combine all of these types of simulations seamlessly and effectively (e.g. a training scenario with human soldiers, AI-controlled enemies, and real guns with virtual feedback)
    - HLA itself is composed of several pieces, all working together:
        - There are RULES that each of the simulations/federates must follow to achieve proper interaction
        - The OBJECT MODEL TEMPLATE defines the format for objects that need to be passed between federates or that are common to the whole federation, along with their attributes and relationships
            - This is documented in the "Federation Object Model (FOM)"
        - The INTERFACE SPECIFICATION provides an interface to the RUN-TIME INFRASTRUCTURE (RTI), the program that coordinates all of the individual systems together
            - When running, each of the individual federates will pass information/receive commands from the RTI, which will then handle message-passing between the different federates

- So, HLA doesn't define the the software itself at all, but the interfaces that the software uses to communicate with the outside world
    - There are these 3 parts, but what are the rules that HLA simulations need to follow?
        - As it turns out, there are only 10 rules we need to do this! Here're just a few of the important ones:
            - The federation as a whole needs to have some sort federation-wise object model that's "safe ground" for all systems to use
            - All of the state variables for the simulation need to reside in the federates themselves, NOT the runtime infrastructure itself
                - This means the RTI is stateless, and can be reused MUCH more easily
            - Federates MUST interact with each other through the interfaces ONLY (no backdoors!)
            - Federates need to be able to manage their own local time in a way that lets them coordinate with the other processes
                - Does this sound similar to the parallel synchronization we've been doing? Because it should sound SUSPICIOUSLY similar...

- What about the Object Model Template (OMT)?
    - The best way to think about this is that it's a common object model; all the class hierarchies in the simulation 
        - There are are few different object models:
            - Each individual simulation has a "Simulation Model Object" (SOM) that describes its internal objects that can be accessed by other federates
            - The "Federation Object Model (FOM)" is defined for the WHOLE federation, and describes all the shared objects in the federation and their relationships/attributes 
        - Again, the standardized thing is NOT the content of these tables, but their format
    - The OMT itself is a documentation format for describing these things (?), and is defined using tables for the objects and their attributes/relationships, probably the most important of which is the CLASS STRUCTURE TABLE
        - This defines the classes and class hierarchies that all the federates in the federation can safely use and pass to a different simulation; if it isn't defined in this table, it has to stay strictly inside a single simulation alone
        - Another important table is the ATTRIBUTE TABLE, which says what the attributes/variables within each class are and the possible values they can take on

- Finally, and arguably most importantly, is the Interface specification
    - Broadly, there are 6 categories of services defined in the HLA:
        - FEDERATION management services, which manage the execution of the system itself (e.g. for starting/ending new federates, for individual simulators joining the federation, pausing/resuming the sim, etc.)
        - DECLARATION management, where each simulation says what type of information it can send/receive or import/export
            - For instance, if we're making a driving simulator, the screen component might say that it wants to receive car position info, but doesn't output anything to the rest of the federates
        - OBJECT management services are what we'll use to actually pass data between different simulations, and to change values on objects
        - OWNERSHIP management allows us to change what federate "owns" a particular object
        - TIME management are the services we use to keep the different federates in sync
        - DATA DISTRIBUTION management is used to efficiently route/transfer data through the system
    - Broadly, here's what a typical federation run will look like:
        - First, the federation will be initializes
            - One of the federates will create the federation, then the other simulations will join it
        - Then all the federates will declare the objects that are going to be shared
            - Each of the federates will say what information they're sharing AND what information they want to "listen to," using the declaration management
        - For the rest of the simulation, the federates will be exchanging data (updating object values w/ Object management, advancing time, etc.)
        - Finally, when the simulation is done, we'll terminate the federation

- Message passing isn't a big focus, but here are the important bits you should know about:
    - In a normal program, we always know who we're sending a message to - but that's NOT true in a federation! We don't know who's supposed to get our messages, or who needs that information!
        - We could BROADCAST and send the message to EVERYONE, and let them deal with it, but that's pretty naive - most of the network traffic ends up being wasted on "junk mail"
        - Instead, a more efficient scheme to do this is the PUBLICATION-SUBSCRIPTION model
            - Here, each "producer" thread has a way of saying what kind of data it's making, and each receiver has a way of saying what kind of data it's looking for
                - e.g. Calling "PublishOCA(Car, position)" on one simulation and "SubscribeOCA(Car, position)" on another
                    - Now, every time The 1st federate updates a car's position, the RTI will check to see who's subscribed to (Car, position) and then send that information to federate 2!
            - Using that scheme, we'll only send data from a given federate to the simulations that actually need it - neat!

- Alright - at a high level, that's what the High-Level Architecture is, why it exists, and how it works
    
- The goal of HLA is to take all of these simulations and tie them together, but one of the most difficult parts of this is TIME SYNCHRONIZATION
    - Each individual federate might be a multithreaded program with its own local synchronization techniques, and then, on top of that, we need to coordinate all of these federates with each other!
        - Each of the simulation might be running at a different speed, too!
            - FAST-AS-POSSIBLE simulations don't worry about wall-clock time, and just try to run as fast as they possibly can
            - REAL-TIME simulations try to advance at the same rate as wall-clock time
            - SCALED REAL-TIME advances in sync with wall clock time, but with some scaling factor, like 2x as fast, or 1/3 as fast
    - A big part of this problem is MESSAGE ORDERING
        - So far, we've been trying to send these messages in time-step order
            - Keeping the messages in order prevents temporal artifacts, but can lead to higher latency
        - For real-time simulations, though, we just want to use RECEIVE ORDER, passing the messages to the simulation as fast as we possibly can
            - This minimizes latency, but means that we can end up with weird effects, so it's not used when we need precise analyses
    - To deal with this problem, HLA provides a specification for TIME MANAGEMENT SERVICES
        - This has two parts:
            - An EVENT ORDERING part that runs on the RTI and keeps track of which messages need to be sent in time-stamp order
            - An interface for synchronizing message delivery between the RTI and individual federates
        - There are 3 important specific services:
            - TIME ADVANCE REQUEST advances simulation time for time-stepped federates
                - Here, the local simulation requests that it wants to advance its time forward to a particular amount (e.g. to T=20 seconds)
                    - When the RTI receives that request, it'll then deliver all of the messages it has stored for that federate that have a time stamp less than 20 seconds
                    - When the RTI knows that all TSO messages for that federate have been received, it sends it a time-advance grant message to actually forward the federate's time
            - NEXT MESSAGE REQUEST advances simulation time for event-based federates
                - The goal here is to process all the messages in time-stamp order; to do this, the federate looks at the next smallest event in its future event list
                    - We then want to either process that event, OR the smallest incoming event (if an incoming message has a smaller timestamp)
                - To do this, the federate makes a next message request with its locally smallest event
                    - When the RTI receives that message, it'll check if it has any messages for that federate smaller than that timestamp
                        - If there are, it sends all of those events to the timestamp and grants its request
                        - Otherwise, it advances the federate's time to that timestamp and grants its request
                - REMEMBER, we had a lookahead creep problem back in CMB, and having the smallest local event time let us get around it
                    - HERE, the RTI wants to know our smallest local event's timestamp via next-message request, allowing it to avoid lookahead creep
            - TIME ADVANCE GRANT is a message the RTI sends to the federate to let it know that it's allowed to advance forward in time

- So, this seems pretty great, but what about Time Warp? It can send out wrong messages to simulators that don't know ANYTHING about rollback!
    - How can we prevent optimistic simulations from "leaking" wrong messages out to the other systems?
        - In HLA, we want the simulations to not care about what the others are doing for synchronization; they should "just work" without needing to know about that (i.e. SYNCHRONIZATION TRANSPARENCY)
    - For the conservative federates, we just need to know the lower time bound on messages that we can send, and we're good
        - The RTI will only deliver messages w/ timestamps &lt;= the LBTS for that federate
    - For the optimistic simulations, though, it's a little bit more tricky:
        - It's okay for 2 optimistic simulations to send wrong messages to each other, since they can roll back - but it's NOT okay to send wrong messages to conservative federates
            - The way we deal with this is a "FlushQueue" service that holds messages that could possibly end up being wrong; each federate can choose whether it wants to receive these messages or not
            - We'll also have a "Retract" message that allows us to send anti-messages to the FlushQueue
            - (some more details)

- OKAY - so, this time-management management stuff is complicated, but it's crucial to make sure our simulation works

- ...and that's really it for lecture material in this course! A week from today is the test, and the week after that your projects are due; study hard, and we'll see you later!
