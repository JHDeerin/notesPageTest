//************** Math Review for Modeling- January 15th, 2019 ***************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Microphone testing is underway, with all the customary 1-2-3-testings included
- ...in other news, I apparently sat on the bench for nearly 3 hours. Which 
definitely feels long.
----------------------------------------------------

- "Alright, I'm all mic-ed up now, so I hope you're ready to go!"
    - In the first 2-3 weeks, the schedule will probably shift around a little 
    bit (some of this content Professor Vuduc is covering for the first time)
        - Sayama Chapters 6/7 are mostly what we're going through; if you 
        prefer videos, look up Strogatz
        - "I'll post some study problems for the tests, don't you worry"
            - For the exams: they are NOT math exams, but you will need to do 
            some basic calculus/linear algebra/diff. eq. stuff on them

- For some of the stuff we're getting into, we'll need Calculus, so here's some 
quick things to review:
    - Taylor series expansions!
        - General formula is f(x + y) = f(x) + y*f'(x) + (y^2*f''(x))/2! + ...
            - "Remember, we have to do Taylor series based on a fixed point, so 
            we need to know what f(x) is for some initial value"
                - An alternate way of writing it: f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)*(x-a) + 
                ...
        - For this class you should just be able to do, say, the Taylor series 
        for e^x
    - Basic derivatives/integrals (eg. (x^5)' = 5*x^4, sin/cos, 
    product/division rules, integration by parts, maybe u-substitution, etc.)
    - Basic optimization (critical points (set first derivative to 0), finding 
    min/max of function)
        - Maybe look up Newton's root finding method - if it makes sense to 
        you, you should be good!
    - Quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = (-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/2a)
    - Plotting equations
- "Hopefully, you're looking at this list and saying 'eh, it's been awhile, but 
I think I can do this stuff'"

- Now, we'll also be working with Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) (i.e. 
there's only one variable to deal with in each equation), so let's touch on 
those
    - So, we might have some state variable "x(t)" (or a vector state variable 
    w/ multiple equations inside, e.g. x(t) = [x0(t), x1(t), x2(t), ...])
    - The classic way of doing modeling throughout the years was writing an ODE 
    to describe it; for instance, we can express Newton's 2nd Law as:

        m(d^2x/dt^2) + b(dx/dt) + kx = 0

    - The ORDER of an equation just means the order of the highest derivative 
    in the equation
        - A linear equation has an order of 1, while a non-linear equation has 
        2, 3, 4, etc.
            - "Linear equations are much easier to deal with, but most of the 
            interesting stuff in the world is nonlinear - so we'll be working a 
            lot with non-linear stuff in this class"
    - An AUTONOMOUS equation is one that does NOT depend on time; if we have to 
    know time explicitly to solve for the equation, then it's a NON-AUTONOMOUS 
    equation
        - An example equation would be the equation for a pendulum's motion:

            d^2x/dt^2 + (g/L) * sin(x) = 0

        - NOTE: 2 dots above a variable means "the 2nd derivative of that 
        variable (but I was too lazy to write it out)"
        - So, this'd be a second-order system, but by substituting some stuff 
        we can convert it into a 1st-order system (although we now have 2 
        equations to deal with, i.e. a 2D vector equation)
            - So, to make this one 1st-order:

            y-&gt; = [y0, y1]  =&gt;  d(y-&gt;)/dt = [dy0/dt, dy1/dt] = [y1, -g/L * 
            sin(y0)]

                - Here, y0 = x, y1 = dx/dt ("We're basically just renaming the 
                X variables")
            - Even if the original equation was 3rd-order, 4th-order, etc., we 
            could get it down to a set of 1st-order equations like this 
            eventually
                - "The Sayama book has a section on this in chapter 6 (with 
                example problems) that I think it'd be helpful to look at"

        - On the other hand, let's assume we have some regular, oscillating 
        force pushing on the pendulunm, making it non-autonomous (because of 
        the cos(t) part):

                d2x/dt^2 + g/l * sin(x) = Fcos(t)

            - We can ALSO substitue for "t" to make it autonomous (by 'hiding' 
            the t variable, making the dependence non-explicit (since even if, 
            say, velocity indirectly depends on time, if we know velocity by 
            itself then we can ignore time)):

                y2 = t, dy2/dt = 1

                dy/dt = Fcos(y)

            - "Now, when we're dealing with vector equations, the 'order' means 
            the LENGTH/number of components in the vector, NOT the highest 
            derivative's order"

    - So, let's say we have this equation, where "x" is actually a function 
    x(t):

            dx/dt = k*x

        - What would "x" be? Well, its derivative would have to equal itself, 
        so it'd have to be the exponential function "e^(kt)"!

    - Another example:

            dx/dt = sin(x)

        - What would the answer be? This is actually more complicated than you 
        might think, but there's a technique called "separation of variables" 
        we can use to solve it
            - Basically, since we know x is a function of BOTH "x" and "t", we 
            try to get all of them on one side, solve for one in terms of the 
            other
        - So, for instance, we'd do this:

            dx/dt = sin(x) =&gt;
            1/sin(x) * dx/dt = 1  =&gt;
            integral(1/sin(x)) dx = integral(1) dt =&gt;
            (...magic trig function later...)
            =&gt; t = -ln|csc(x) + cot(x)| + C

        - Then, plug in for x(0), and solve x(t) to get the answer
    - "So, this works, but it's pretty of awkward to solve analytically - is 
    there something easier we can do?"

- Well, as it turns out, if we're only interested in the overall/asymptotic 
behavior of the system, we can get pretty far just by graphing points and 
analyzing the behavior (approaching the problem geometrically)!
    - The first technique we can use is making a PHASE PORTRAIT, where we'd 
    sketch the equation (e.g. sin(x) for the last example)
        - We can then see if there's any critical points for us to look at, 
        e.g. where the derivative (in this case sin(x)) is 0
            - Between those points, we can then at least figure out if the 
            derivative is positive or negative (i.e. if the ORIGINAL function 
            is increasing or decreasing)
        - If the derivatives point TOWARDS the critical point, then it's stable 
        (the equation will tend to go towards that point); if the derivatives 
        point AWAY from it (i.e. positive derivative above it, negative 
        derivative below it), then it's unstable
            - These stable points are called ATTRACTORS, and the others are 
            called UNSTABLE
                - "...we just got lazy with the second name, I guess"
    - So, given all this information, we don't know EXACTLY how to draw x(t) - 
    but we can get a pretty good idea, since we know the points where the 
    derivative is unchanging and the sections where the function is 
    increasing/decreasing
        - "Furthermore, for a given starting position (i.e. x0), we can figure 
        out roughly what it's behavior might be - which section of the graph 
        it's going towards, which attractors it might be heading towards, etc."
- A good exercise might be to do this for "dx/dt = x^2 - 1" - "find the 
critical points, and classify them each as stable or unstable"
    - You should also do the same thing for "dx/dt = x - cos(x)"
        - This LOOKS more complicated, but remember, we're still following the 
        same steps:
            1) Find the x-values where dx/dt = 0 (the critical points, or 
            "fixed points")
                - For this, that means where x = cos(x)
            2) Figure out which regions the derivative is positive/negative for
            3) Label the points based on where the derivatives are pointing

- So, why do we care about these regions? Let's say we're part of an elite team 
of bug conservationists, and we're examining the population of the bugs in a 
given swamp. We'd want to know if there's a certain point where the bug 
population will explode, or go extinct - if we have a rough equation for how 
the population CHANGES, we can use differential equations to figure this out, 
and the regions tell us which way the equation will go - if it'll go towards 
one point (extinction) or the other!

- (NOTE: I think I used x/t interchangably here)
- Speaking of population, let's look at one of the most famous models of 
population - the logistic curve!
    - This was discovered by some Dutch guy named Verhulst in 1838 - "With a 
    name like that he's gotta be Dutch, right?"
- Let's say we know what the population is right now, and we want to know how 
that'll affect population growth in the future
    - "This is an initial value problem, or IVP"
        - We could go with a linear growth model, x' = r*x(t) ...but this means 
        the population will grow forever
        - We could go with an exponential model, x' = x * e^(rt), but that 
        means that the population will either keep growing forever (if r &gt; 0) 
        or keep shrinking forever (if r &lt; 0) - that's not how the real world 
        works!
    - Instead, Verhulst observed that the population tends to grow faster up to 
    a certain point, then start slowing down when the environment can't handle 
    so many people (he called this limit the "carrying capacity," k0)
        - To model this, he used the exponential equation, but with 1 major 
        difference: the rate of growth was a variable!

            r(x) = r0 - r0/k0 * x

        - So, plugging into the exponential equation for this:

            x' = r0*(1 - (x/k0)) *x = r0*x - (x^2)*(r0)/k0

        - This has critical points at x = 0 and x = k0 - which makes sense!
            - If there's 0 population, nothing changes!
            - If there's more the max population, nothing changes!

    - So, that was how he come up with this model - but is it valid?
        - Well, experiments have shown that this model pretty accurately models 
        population for bacteria culture, yeast, etc. - but even for animal 
        populations it starts to break down, and it's only kinda accurate for 
        human populations

- So, that's most of the math you'll need to get through this course. We'll 
keep trucking along on Thursday, so bring your thinking caps along and we'll 
get together then!
