//************* Stability and Bifurcations - January 17th, 2019 *************//
//**************************************************************************//

- ...welp, it appears only 3 people joined me at the front, so I'm directly in 
the line of fire. This terrifies me.
    - *squirms*
- "While the projector is warming up, someone mentioned I made a math mistake 
when modeling the logistic curve last lecture - I've posted some stuff 
correcting that on Piazza"
----------------------------------------

- Okay, last time we talked about the logistic curve to wrap up the day, and 
classifying its stable/unstable points
    - "If you're looking for ways to practice this stuff, look either in the 
    Sayama book, or the questions I and the TAs hope to post shortly"

- As we mentioned, though, this logistic model seems to not work for organisms 
more complicated than bacteria...so what's this model missing?
    - Well, animal populations tend to look a little more oscillatory - they go 
    up and down over time
        - But the logistic curve's derivative can't produce oscillations - we 
        need additional state variables so that x can go back and forth over 
        time! (I think?)

- Our analysis yesterday was largely based on the phase portrait, but there's 
another mode of analysis called LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS
    - Basically, this is the quickie derivation for the "negative 
    stable/positive unstable/zero idunno" thing from Differential Equations
    - This is in the Sayama book (I believe in Chapter 7?), but we'll do a 
    quick overview here
    - Consider a system like this:

            x' = f(x)

            x(t) = x* + n(t), where n(t) is "small"

        - Therefore (since derivative of a constant value x* is 0),

            x'(t) = n'(t) = f(x* + n) (i.e., their derivatives are the same!)

        - So, since we have the equation in terms of "f(x* + something)," let's 
        choose n = some-really-small-away-from-x* something, and then we can do 
        a Taylor expansion to try and understand it better:

             = f(x*) + n*f'(x*) + O(n^2) + O(n^3) + ...

        - "Since we know n is a super small value we chose away from our base 
        point, let's pretend that all the squared terms are small enough to 
        ignore"

            ~= f(x*) + nf'(x*)

        - By definition of critical points,

            ~= 0 + nf'(x*) = nf'(x*)

        - HOWEVER, we said this was equals to n'(t) AS WELL, so we have:

                n'(t) = n*f'(x*)

        - "What function is equal to its derivative? The exponential!" SO, we 
        know

            n(t) = e^(f'(x*) * t)

        - SO, based on this interpretation, we can see how the derivative 
        changes based on the value of f'(x*):
            - If it's &lt; 0, the function is decaying
            - If it's &gt; 0, the function is growing
            - If it's 0, we're...uncertain
- ...basically, we're taking a *little* step to the left or right of our point 
and seeing if the stability of the function changes as a result

- As a more concrete example, let's say we have:

        x' = sin(x) = f(x)

    - So, we know sin(x) = 0 at x* = k*pi
        - Furthermore, f'(x) = cos(x)
- (...might need to read the book for this, wasn't 100% sure where he was going 
unless he just meant that the value of the derivative)

- So, if we have a fixed point we've identified, and we've done this Taylor 
analysis, then we can hopefully determine the stability of the point!

- If this were a math class, we'd have to talk about if solutions exist/if 
those solutions are unique or not...but for the most part, we'll just assume 
that solutions do actually exist in this class
    - i.e. just because we computed one solution, there could be others
    - One useful theory thing to know: the "Sufficient Condition for 
    Uniqueness" theorem:
        - If we're given an IVP (i.e. x(0) = x0, x'=f(x)), and both f(x) and 
        f'(x) are continuous in the interval (a,b), then there exists a time 
        interval (-t, +t) about t=0 where x(t) has a unique solution
            - So, we can figure out if a solution definitely exists, but the 
            range for that solution might be very small
     - e.g. x' = 1 + x^2, x0 = 0
        - The solution is x(t) = tan(t), but it only exists in the range 
        (-pi/2, pi/2) - past those asymptotes, the function blows up!
- "Again, we won't deal with this stuff very much in our class, but it is a 
concern for resarchers"

- Alright, let's now talk about bifurcations
    - Here's a question we have: as the parameters of a given model change, how 
    does its stability change?
        - For instance, if we have a block that's perfectly balanced on a beam, 
        and we place larger and larger blocks on it, what'll happen? Well, 
        eventually it'll start to bend, and possibly even break!
    - So, it was stable while it was straight, but changing the mass eventually 
    made it (mathematically and literally) unstable

        x = shape of the beam
        r = mass of block

- In particular, we're interested in SADDLE-NODE BIFURCATIONS
    - Consider the diff. eq. x' = r + x^2
        - At r = 0, this equation is just a concave-up parabola with one 
        critical point
            - By our stability analysis stuff, this is "half stable;" the 
            derivative is pointing towards the origin on the negative side and 
            away from it on the positive
        - If r &lt; 0, the parabola will move DOWN, an we'll now have 2 critical 
        points (one stable and one unstable)
        - If r &gt; 0, then the parabola will be above the axis, so there'll be NO 
        critical points and therefore no stable ones!
    - So, if we graph the critical points (x*) on the y-axis and the mass (r) 
    on the x-axis, we'd end up with a sideways parabola open toward the 
    negative side (w/ the negative points stable, and the positive ones 
    unstable)
        - This shows how the critical points change in response to changes in 
        other parameters, and which of the points are stable/unstable
        - This particular case, where there are 2 critical points, looks 
        vaguely like a saddle, and is thus known as a saddle bifurcation
    - "To be specific, a SADDLE NODE BIFURCATION is the point where 2 critical 
    points merge into 1 for some value of r, as r changes"
        - In general, "bowl-shaped" functions like parabolas tend to create 
        these points
- As an example, try doing the x*/r plots for "x' = r - x^2"
    - If you do an LSA for this, what'll you find? Well, you'll find that
    
         x* = +- sqrt(r)

    - Which'll mean that the critical points should only exist where r is 
    positive - which makes sense!
- Another one to try: x' = r - x - e^(-x)
    - "This looks complicated, since it's not easy to find the zeroes, but 
    geometrically we could try drawing the equivalent r - x = e^(-x) and find 
    roughly where they intersect"
    - From there, we can conclude that there are 2 fixed/critical points when r 
    &gt; 1, exactly 1 point when r = 1 (when the "r-x" line is tangent to e^-x, 
    i.e. their derivatives are equal), and none when r &lt; 1
        - In this example, r=1 is the "critical r" where the bifuraction occurs
- "If you do a Taylor expansion of e^-x, you should see some x^2-like 'bowlish' 
functions begin appearing, and that's partly why it has a saddle bifurcation"
    - There's a whole system of theory called "normal forms" that defines what 
    bifurcations can appear for different types of curves, and x^2 is the 
    demesne of the saddle

- *20 minutes left*..."Hmmm, should I do the complicated one or the easy one..."
    - Also, scary notification noise! "New assignment: for the next week of 
    your life, just count how many times something beeps"
- (ended up doing more examples)

- So, we'll probably spend at least 1 more class going over analyzing this 
nonlinear ODE dynamics stuff before we start getting into discrete modeling
    - "We're...um...some sports analogy away from getting the random teams out 
    to you guys, so be on the lookout for those sometime this weekend."
- In the meantime, have a good weekend, see you Tuesday, and hopefully I didn't 
hurt your brain too much!
