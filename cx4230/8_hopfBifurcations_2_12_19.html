//******************* Hopf Bifurcations - February 12th, 2019 ***************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Okay, we have about 3 more classes before your first midterm, and then only 1 
more class past that before your first project is due - so keep an eye on that! 
Keep working on your project!
- The checkpoints should be graded; for the most part, the ones we looked at 
seemed fine, but please ask questions about what's expected, what you need to 
do to impress us, etc.
-----------------------------------------------

- Last time, we ended up by looking at 2D systems where bifurcations occur, and 
we saw that they're similar to (but more complicated than) the bifurcations we 
saw in the 1D case
    - We gave one example problem at the very end, which Professor Vuduc plans 
    to post solutions to when he has time

- What we just saw were "supercritical" and "subcritical" bifurcations - those 
occur when the eigenvalues are real, but remember, we're in 2D now! These 
eigenvalues can be complex, and that leads us to a new kind of bifurcation: the 
HOPF BIFURCATION
    - So, if our Jacobian matrix has complex eigenvalues near a fixed point, 
    what sort of bifurcations might we expect to see?
        - There might be a circle/cycle around the critical point, where if a 
        point is closer than this radius it spirals outwards, and if it's 
        farther away, it spirals in - is there some way this behavior might 
        change?
            - Let's say the two eigenvalues are "negative real part +/- i" 
            (i.e. negative complex conjugates), so that the two solutions start 
            out stable
            - Imagine that as we change some other parameter of the model, the 
            real part of the eigenvalue starts to increase and become positive
        - So we can more clearly understand the "radius growing/shrinking" 
        idea, let's pretend we've moved into polar coordinate world - which, to 
        remind you, means:

                Coordinate = (r, theta), where r &gt;= 0
                x0 = r*cos(theta)
                x1 = r*sin(theta)

            - Let's say, then, that we're working with an example problem like 
            this:

                    r' = ar + r^3 - r^5
                    theta' = 1

                - This means the object has a constant rotation, but the radius 
                term is a little more complicated
                    - In the 1D case, when an equation included cubic and 
                    quintic terms, it was possible for us to see some 
                    HYSTERESIS in this system, where as we change the parameter 
                    the critical point passes through a section of instability 
                    before becoming stable again, meaning we have to "jump" to 
                    get back to the stable part again
                    - In 2D (missed, but basically there's an analog of this, I 
                    think?)
                - Given these equations, the actual problem is this: "Analyze 
                bifurcations in the region -1/4 &lt; a &lt; 0 for this system"
                - Let's rewrite the equation for r as:

                        r' = r(a + r^2 - r^4)

                    - So, we immediately know there's a critical point r* = 0
                    - If we solve for r, we'll also find r* = 0.5 +/- sqrt(1/4 
                    + a)
                        - "Remember, this is NOT a fixed point, but a circle of 
                        points with radius r* - welcome to Polar World!"
                - So, looking at the cases for a:
                    - If a = -1/4, there're critical values for r at {0, 1/2}
                        - So, is the origin stable? Is this ring at r=1/2 
                        stable?
                            - If we imagine that r &lt; 1/2, then r^2 = 1/4 and 
                            r^4 = 1/16, which means that:

                                a + r^2 - r^4 = -0.5 + 0.25 - 1/16 = -0.25 - 
                                1/16
                            
                            - So, this'll be negative! The radius is decreasing 
                            and going TOWARDS the origin, but away from r = 1/2!
                            - If r &gt; 1/2 (say, for instance, r = 1), then:

                                a + r^2 - r^4 = -0.5 + 1 - 1 = -0.5

                            - So, it'll go towards the 1/2 ring if r &gt; 1/2, and 
                            away from it (towards the origin) if r &lt; 1/2
                        - So, the origin is stable, but the 1/2 ring is only 
                        half-stable
                    - Generalizing this for -1/4 &lt; a &lt; 0:
                        - There'll now be a fixed point at the origin, and then 
                        TWO fixed rings at "1/2 +/- sqrt(1/4 + a)"
                            - This means that the single ring at r=1/2 has 
                            split into two rings!
                                - When a = 0 again, though, then the 2nd ring 
                                will have a radius of 0, so we'll end up with 
                                only 1 ring again
                            - If we analyze their stability, inside the inner 
                            circle, points will still decay towards the origin; 
                            between the two rings, it'll expand outwards; and 
                            outside the large circle, it'll decay towards the 
                            origin
                            - This means the origin and the outer ring are 
                            stable, while the inner ring is unstable
                    - Finally, for a = 0, we get r* = {0, 1} - which means r &gt; 
                    1 is decreasing, and r &lt; 1 is increasing
                        - So, in this case, the origin is unstable (it spirals 
                        outwards), and the r=1 ring is stable
    - PHEW - that was a lot, but what does this example show for bifurcations? 
    It shows that for a brief range of 'a' (namely, -1/4 &lt; a &lt; 0), this ring of 
    instability briefly appears, and the origin turns from a stable point to an 
    unstable point
- So, a HOPF BIFURCATION is when the eigenvalues either are complex or become 
complex, and the fixed point goes for some parameter value's range from being 
stable to unstable (or vice-versa)
    - There's two versions: a "supercritical Hopf" bifurcation (where r' = ar - 
    r^3) where a stable critical point becomes unstable as an uncritical ring 
    shrinks onto it, and a "subcritical Hopf" (where r' = ar + r^3) where an 
    unstable critical point becomes stable, with a ring of stability around it 
    shrinking onto it
        - The supercritical case is considered "safe," since even if the 
        results blow up, they'll be "caught" by the stable ring around the 
        origin
        - The subcritical case, on the other hand, is considered "unsafe," 
        because even though the immediate area around the origin is now stable, 
        if we escape that region of attraction, the results could explode

- Okay - but WHY do we care? Well, if the origin of (0,0) is a desirable stable 
point for us, and we're increasing some lever on our machine, then at SOME 
POINT it'll jump and become unstable, and the system will suddenly jump to the 
stable ring where r=1
    - If the system is stock prices of goal in Angola, for instance, and the 
    parameter is the amount we're paying miners, then if we tweak the payrate 
    just a *little* down, prices could PLUMMET

- ...alright, that might've been a bit messy, but I think we're ready to make 
another jump: from the flat planes of 2D systems to the mountains of 3D!
    - And to begin, let's look at an extremely famous 3D system: the Lorenz 
    System!
        - Lorenz was a weather scientist at MIT in the 1960s, trying to model 
        weather patterns on a computer
        - When Professor Vuduc was a student at Cornell under Professor 
        Strogatz, he watched a video on "Chaotic Water Wheels," where a wheel 
        with a bunch of leaky water-holding cups on it spins around as water 
        sprays the cups from a hose (like a regular water wheel), with 
        variables representing the angular velocity of the wheel, the flow rate 
        of water into/out of the cups, and the angle of the wheel
        - Lorenz was using a very similar model to this in his weather research 
        to analyze convection, and it looked something like this (x is the 
        rotational velocity, y is the difference in water volume between the 
        wheel's left/right halves, and z is the difference in water volume 
        between the top/bottom):

            x' = a*(y - x)
            y' = rx - y - xz
            z' = xy - bz

        - There are nonlinearities here (x*z, for instance), but they look 
        pretty simple, right? It's not TOO nonlinear
        - Another thing we see is that this system is symmetric in X and Y; if 
        (x, y, z) is a solution, then so will (-x, -y, z)
        - But (and this is where things start to get weird), as t -&gt; infinity, 
        all the volumes in the phase space start going to 0!
            - What does this mean? Well, if we plotted these variables x/y/z on 
            a 3D graph, the surface defined by x=y=z always shrank into nothing 
            eventually
            - At first glance, that seems to indicate that the solutions settle 
            down into some fixed point, right? So there must be a critical 
            point, right? Well, NOPE! It turns out it isn't that at all!
        - Lorenz realized this, and started looking for bifurcations in the 
        system - and specifically, he began looking at how the system changed 
        as he changed the value of 'r' (which appears in y')
            - For 1 &lt; r &lt; rh, he found that the system acted like a subcritical 
            Hopf, where 'rh' was the bifurcation point (i.e. a fixed point 
            suddenly become unstable as r grew to rh)
                - So, at r = 1, the single fixed point split into 2 (like a 
                pitchfork bifurcation) - but then, at the rh point, each of the 
                two trajectories splits AGAIN
        - Lorenz was really confused by this behavior, so he turned to the one 
        tool he thought could help him: a 1960s mainframe computer. He plugged 
        in his equations with a = 10, b = 8/3, and r = 28 (since rh ~= 24.7), 
        and...

- Well, we ran out of time, so you'll have to hear the end of the story...next 
time.
