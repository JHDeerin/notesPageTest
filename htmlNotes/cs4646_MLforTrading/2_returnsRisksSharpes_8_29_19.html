//********** Returns, Risk, and Sharpe's Ratio - August 29th, 2019 **********//
//**************************************************************************//

- "So, this class is already starting to thin out a little, which is an unfortunate reality at Georgia Tech..."
- Also, Project 1 is due THIS SUNDAY; don't forget!
    - If you still have questions, there're office hours tomorrow; don't count on TAs answering questions over the weekend! (Although many of them still do, because they're awesome)
- Project 2, then, is due NEXT week; we'll cover most of what you need to do it this lecture, and the last bit you need next week
    - These first 2 projects are worth less to ease you into the class, but that's no reason to start off in the hole when you don't have to
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- So, today we'll go over some more "financial statistics", talk about issues with measuring risk/returns separately, and how to combine
    - We'll also show you how to assess a portfolio in just 4 lines of code, which'll be VERY useful to know for project 2

- Last time, we just talked about cumulative returns, and how they're a good way to measure the worth of a stock over time in a single number
    - With cumulative return, we only care about the buying price and the selling price; nothing in-between matters!
        - If we just plotted starting/ending price alone, it might not be obvious what stock actually performed the best; if we divide each stock's price by its initial purchase price, though, and plotted the cumulative return for each stock instead, we've normalized it!
            - This makes it MUCH easier to compare different stocks; since they're now all on the same scale, the line that's the highest is the best!
                - ...assuming we ignore risk
                - "In general, we'll expect you to normalize to 1.0 in this class"
            - Doing this in pandas isn't bad at all:

                ```python
                df = df/df.iloc[0]      # broadcasts division to all df elements
                ```
    
- There's an issue with just measuring this "absolute" stock performance, though
    - Let's say I bought IBM 5 years ago, and the price is now at 85% of its starting value - that's not great! I lost 15%!
        - HOWEVER, let's say that over that same period of time the SPY-stock (representing the economy) dropped 30% due to a recession. Suddenly, my investment looks a lot better; I lost money, but less money than the rest of the stock market!
    - Because of that, it's often better to measure BENCHMARK-RELATIVE PERFORMANCE, where we subtract or divide our daily returns by our benchmark's change in value
        - The benchmark we choose does matter; you don't want to penalize strategies that lose money in the Great Depression, or reward them for making money in a bull market
            - Not doing this is a VERY common reason for papers being rejected, since it means your measurements will be too optimistic/pessimistic
    - This'll get you "Market-Relative Daily Returns," which is a good place to be

- Now, one thing you'll notice quickly with real-world data is that stock data isn't often clean, and we need to deal with that
    - For instance, there might be some oil companies that fly under the radar and don't trade at all some days, then some great news about a new well they've hit comes out 
        - We can't assume that we're magically recording precise data every moment, or that there're no gaps or missing data in our set
        - The stock numbers you see on the news almost never come from raw stock exchange number, but the NBBO ("National Best-Bid Offer"), which is an aggregate of data from different sources
            - The problem with using this data is that it simply doesn't give us all the data; it's slower to update, 
    - We can have times when no stocks trade due to government investigations, lack of news, etc., so we can have missing data for some of our stocks at certain times
        - This means we'd have stock charts with "holes" in their lines, represented as NaNs in numpy
            - Matplotlib is smart enough not to plot these, but it's a HUGE problem for our learning algorithms
        - So, how can we deal with missing data?
            - Replacing NaN with 0s is TERRIBLE, because it makes our learner think a crash happened, followed by a massive jump!
            - Forward-filling/back-filling (i.e. just using the last datapoint we have) has the same problem, since it gives us a sudden, non-existent jump/fall in price
            - Linearly interpolating is better, but it falsely shows the stock as having no volatility/noise, which might make it think a stock is more predictable than it really is
                - It also means we're using data from the future to estimate older stock prices - which is bad! It's SUPER important that we don't use information from the future for ML, since we never have access to future information in the real world
        - So, in this class for ML, any type of interpolation to close the gap is going to be an issue; instead, we'll just use FORWARD-FILLING, since it tells our learner to ignore that stock when it was off the market
            - This isn't perfect - or even all that great, since the sudden jump is a problem - but it's a realistic interpretation of the problem: not knowing how the stock's price has changed until the news comes out!
                - "This still stinks, but it's the least-stinky easy solution we have"
            - There are more sophisticated, better things we could do, like filling it in based on the rest of the market's performance (based on its historical), but we won't expect that for this class
    - There's still one issue: what happens if a brand-new stock IPOs, and we don't have trade data on it for the first few days/minutes/etc. until it actually hits the market?
        - In this case, we CAN justify doing back-filling, since it tells our learner nothing interesting was happening until the stock actually started trading!
            - So, we'll just take the first actual stock price we have, and then backfill all our previous NaNs with that value
- As a side-question: why do we have to fill in the data at all?
    - "You could try and make NaN a special case for your classifier, but that makes your code more complicated and doesn't have as clear of a meaning"

- "Okay, any more important questions or objections?...I know I'm asking you to self evaluate on that one"

- Another problem we'll mention, but not dive into too much: stock tickers ARE reused, so if you're trading over long periods of time (like 10-20 years), watch out!
    - For instance, there used to be a coffee company with the stock symbol "JAVA"; it went out of business, the symbol wasn't used for several years, and then Sun Microsystems starting trading under "JAVA" instead
    - As another side-note: we'll mostly be talking about fairly short-term trading in this class. Doing long-term trading strategies with machine learning requires some very different approaches that we probably won't get into.

- So, we've got a reasonable way to measure how much return a stock is giving us - but what that doesn't take into account is RISK
    - With regard to stocks, RISK usually means the "standard deviation of a stock's returns over time"
        - If a stock is super volatile and is going up and down constantly, we would say it's more risky and less predictable than a slow-and-steady stock

- The problem now, then, is how do we compare stocks with different risks and rewards?
    - If a very risky stock only gives us a few percent better returns than a stock that's very reliable, we'd probably want to invest in the more reliable stock, right?
        - And if two stocks have the SAME returns, but one is riskier than the other, we'd obviously want to take the less volatile one!
    - So, the tricky case is figuring out which stock is "better" when the riskier, more volatile stock gives higher returns than the safer stock - so how do we choose?
- There are a TON of ways to compare this, but one of the simplest ways is the SHARPE RATIO (invented by economist William Sharpe)
    - This is a quantitative measure of a stock's "risk-adjusted return," which is its returns after being penalized a bit for volatility
    - To actually calculate this, we need 3 different things:
        1) A list of the daily returns of our portfolio, "Rp"
        2) The standard deviations of our portfolio's daily returns, "Sp"
        3) A list of the "risk-free" returns "Rf"
            - This is here just because there are near-risk-free ways of making money, like government bonds or money market accounts; if we can't beat this benchmark, then we might as well go with
            - "I usually say it's unlikely the U.S. government will collapse in the next 3 months, but I'll refrain from that this semester"
    - So, if we want a higher Sharpe's ratio to be better, we'd want high returns, low volatility, and to use our risk-free returns as a benchmark (*cough* subtraction *cough*)
        - That's the gist of the idea behind what this thing is!
    - More mathematically, the Sharpe ratio is "the expectation of our returns subtracted by "
        - ...in other words:

            SR = Expectation(Rp - Rf) / std(Rp - Rf)

    - Practically, though, we often treat our risk-free returns as a constant, since it doesn't vary that much, so we might calculate it like this:

            SR = mean(dailyReturns - dailyRisk_f) / std(dailyRet)

    - The problem with this, though, its that it's VERY sensitive to the frequency we're doing (if we're doing daily trades, weekly averages, etc.)
        - So instead, what we'll ACTUALLY use is the annualized Sharpe Ratio:

                ASR = sqrt(k) * SR

            - ...where "k" is the number of samples we take in a given year
                - So, if we were using weekly averages, "k" would be 52

    - ...we'll talk more about Sharpe's ratio, and alternatives to it, when we get deeper into the finance part

- So in assignment 2, to calculate your portfolio's performance, you just need to calculate your daily returns, calculate Sharpe's ratio, and then know "k" to annualize it

- With the last 5 minutes, let's talk about a quick way to calculate a portfolio's daily returns in Python/numpy
    - Let's say we have a numpy array "prices" with a row for each day and a column for each stock, with each data point being a raw price; how can we do this?
        1) Get each stock's cumulative return, which we can do by just dividing each column by its first price!

            prices /= prices[0]

        2) We'll then multiply by our allocations (i.e. the percentage of our portfolio that each stock is)
            - Assuming we have this stored in a 1D array like [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], this would be:

                prices *= allocations

        3) We'd then multiply this by the total amount of cash we have in our portfolio
            
            prices *= cash

        4) Then, to get an array of our portfolio's total value on any given day, we'll just sum each row together!

            prices.sum(axis=1)

    - So, all together, it just looks like this!

        ```python
        prices /= prices[0]
        prices *= allocations
        prices *= cash
        return prices.sum(axis=1)
        ```

- Alright, that's it for today! Don't forget about project 1 is due this weekend, and I'll see you next week!</pre>
