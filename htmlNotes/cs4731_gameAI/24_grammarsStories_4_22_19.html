//********** Grammars (cont.) / Story Generation - April 22nd, 2019 *********//
//**************************************************************************//

- ...the last lecture, and, appropriately enough as Avengers:Endgame approaches, half of the room appears to have been Thanos'd
    - ...this reference is going to be ridiculously out of data in a few years 
- "I know, I know, you're all excited to get rid of me, but afraid to say it"
    - ...I'm not excited :(

- AS YOU ALSO KNOW, Friday is the final exam for this class
    - It will be in THIS classroom, April 26th, from 2:40pm to 5:30pm
        - It'll be 20 questions instead of 10 questions, since it's the final; half of the questions will be on this last 1/3rd of the course, while the other half will be cumulative
    - "I'll try not to mess up any of the questions again, but let's be real: something'll probably go wrong"
----------------------------------------------------

- So, in this lastest of last lectures, we're going to wrap up grammars and then talk a little bit about Professor Riedl's research (i.e. AI-created stories)

- What were grammars, again? Well, they're basically a go-between for procedural generation, where we define the rules that govern the system, but the algorithm can do whatever it likes with those rules
    - We can basically define either long sequences with these things (the traditional way), or
        - Remember, a functional L-system lets us replace any token in the string in PARALLEL, where we call all applicable functions in the string at once
            - This also means the functions will get drawn AS we run, instead of only once we've generated the entire string

- On Friday, we were trying to generate a road system, based off of 5 rules we had, like so:

        Road(delay == 0, start, width) -&gt; Nil # just generate the road, don't change the grammar

        Road(delay &gt; 0, start, width) == True -&gt; Branch(delay, start, width-1)Branch(delay, start, width-1)Road(delay, ) # if we successfully built a road

        Road(delay &gt; 0, start, width) == False -&gt; Nil # if the road-creating function returns false (i.e. not enough space to build the road), just stop this segment

        Branch(delay &gt; 0, start, width) --&gt; Branch(delay-1, start, width)

        Branch(delay == 0, start, width) --&gt; Road(delay, start, width)


    - The "delay" parameter isn't anything intrinsic to these L systems, but a way we can use parameters to tell the difference between major and minor roads
        - The idea here is that this will make major roads be built first, since it means any roads that branch off of our current road will need to wait until delay == 0 for the branches to start growing; this gives major roads to "right of way" to take the best building locations, and the minor roads then have to grow around them
    - So, let's start building a road network from this!

            R(2,2)

        - Assuming this returns true, we'll get:

            B(2,1)B(2,1)R(2,2)

        - Again, since this is is an L-system, we'll process ALL of these functions simultaneously:

            B(1,1)B(1,1)B(2,1)B(2,1)R(2,2)

        - So, the 2 new B(2,1)'s mean that branches will be built at that location 2 steps in the future! Let's keep going

            B(0,1)B(0,1)B(1,1)B(1,1)B(2,1)B(2,1)R(2,2)
            R(0,1)R(0,1)B(0,1)B(0,1)B(1,1)B(1,1)B(2,1)B(2,1)R(2,2)

        - So, the branches finally started growing into roads!
            - (Professor Riedl just noticed he doesn't have a way for these newly-created roads to keep growing)
                - "For those of you who flunk this class, I promise to get it right next year!"
    - Which direction do these roads grow in, though? That information isn't in our L-system!
        - Well, that's NOT part of the grammar! Instead, we delegate it to the game engine function we're calling to decide the actual micro-placment of the road (e.g. making sure it doesn't go straight up mountains, goes around dangerous areas, etc.)

- That seems pretty good, but we have a problem: these roads only branch, and NEVER create loops or connections! That means we'd end up with neighborhoods composed entirely of cul-de-sacs!
    - So, how're we gonna create intersections from this tree we're generating? We'll do post-processing, where we'll connect two roads that seem to be "running into" each other in the game
        - Once we've done that, we can identify closed sections between the roads to find lots, plop buildings down onto those lots as we see fit, and slowly build up a cit from 

- ...and, as it turns out, that's really as far as we'll go with grammars in this class
    - Make sure you understand the difference between L-systems and regular context-free grammars, and that "delay" is just one parameter we happened to pass to a functional L-system and not something we specifically need to have
        - Also, that non-functional grammars really just generate strings left-to-right, and you then need something separate to actually make use of them, whereas functional L-systems are constantly making calls to the game engine itself

- So, with that, let's hear a bit about what Professor Riedl does for a living ("I've got 45 minutes and nothing better to talk about, right?")
    - As it turns out, people have been working on making story-generating things literally for as long as AIs have been around, even back to the 1930s
        - Stories are interesting because, however you look at them, they seem pretty fundamental as a human activity; we tell stories ALL the time
        - For Professor Riedl, sometimes that means focusing on "entertaining" stories, while other times it means focusing on day-to-day "functional" stories ("I went to the restaurant, I saw my old friend Bob, I said Hi to him, I put my table together with him, we at together, paid separately, and then left")
            - Did we arrive at the restaurant together? No - but that information isn't in the text! How's a robot supposed to figure things out?
                - See, all of us have SCHEMAS for how restaurants and basic social interactions work (well...most of us), so we can fill in the gaps in this story without even thinking about it - but robots don't have that context!
                    - For us, this is "common sense reasoning," but not so for Mr. Robot
        - Early story generation systems in the 1960s were basically Mad Lib playing systems: just take a grammar and replace the symbols with names
        - 1970s saw the introduction of rule-based systems for making stories, and
            - To get these things to work, though, we needed to provide a BUNCH of rules to the AI to try and provide the context we humans have that it lacks, with constraints, goals, subgoals, etc.
                - For instance, "poison ?noun," "if-has ?noun," "counter ?verb," etc.
            - As it turns out, these things were basically the same as Hierarchical Task Networks - it had a list of tasks it wants to accomplish, and uses the constraints it knows about to determine which tasks it can actually do
                - We could, for instance, view these stories as logic-based rule systems, where we provide preconditions for actions and the effect of actions, and then do behavior planning to find a semi-logical story
                    - Professor Riedl, for instance, created an AI network that tried to work backwards from the goal of "Slay(Aladdin, Genie, Castle)," trying to create a logical sequence of events where Aladdin ends up killing the Genie inside the castle, using the events it knows are possible
                        - Once we have this sequence of events, instead of tying each sequence to events in a game ngine (like in behavior planning), we'll generate a piece of text for each event

- This works great if we're trying to create a formulaic soap opera, but does it get us into any trouble?
    - Around 10 years ago, this is what we were doing, but Professor Riedl wasn't happy; he needed to create an action for EVERY possible thing that could happen in the story, and very few of these actions were reusable between stories
        - What Professor Riedl wanted was OPEN STORY GENERATION: we could ask this thing to generate a story about ANY topic, and in order to do that, these knowledge-intensive "micro-world" approaches just didn't scale
            - So, what do you do when you have too many things to possibly write down? You throw machine learning at it!
        - So, Professor Riedl and several other researchers banded together and created a crowdsourced story system called Scherezade
            - The idea here is that the AI takes a request, like "Tell me a fishing story"
                - If it knows about fishing, it generates a story from what it knows
                - If it DOESN'T know about fishing, it sends out a request to the public domain saying "Please submit a story about fishing, and I'll pay you $1"
                    - ...incidentally, this AI system was hooked up to a bank account, which is SUPER scary
            - Once we have enough of these stories for the same prompt, we'll create a "plot graph" and try to identify the common elements that happen in all of the stories we know (for instance, in a restaurant, it seems like ordering tends to happen before eating)
                - LOTS of statistics involved in this, but let's ignore that
    - Now, this model actually generates pretty good results, since we're dealing with a specialized dataset and relatively small stories
        - For instance, it learned the "script" for going on a movie date without ANYONE having to tell it what the events people wrote about means ("note to the guys: it identified that you hold hands BEFORE you kiss!")
            - "...also, this technically means I taught a robot how to get to first base. I'm sure I'll pay for this later."

- ...BUT, do we want to have 500 people write a story every time we need to learn a new concept? Shouldn't we be able to teach our AI to learn from existing resources, like Wikipedia?
    - Y'know, the parenting thing: "Here's 5 gigs of data. Have fun, then tell me stories for my amusement"
        - In order to do this, we need to use RECURRENT NEURAL NETS, which deal with things in sequence where the order of stuff matters (e.g. words, sentences, etc.)
            - Basically, this is a neural net where the input is all possible words that could be in our sentence (yes, literally like 100,000 words), there's a bunch of hidden networks in the middle, and then the output is the word that's supposed to come next in the sentence
                - Phone autocompletion typically uses a more simplistic Markov chain model, but it's a similar idea; the difference is that neural nets can learn more complex relationships
            - This network is then fed EVERY word in the sentence we're training on
                - You might be thinking: "But Mark, a LOT of different words could come after any given word, right? How do we know which one is right?" Well, it's complicated, but we can ALSO pass in all the previous words in our story as inputs to give the neural net context
        - Now, these networks do NOT understand the context of what they're saying; they're pretty terrible when it comes to keeping stories coherent over times
        - A different way of using neural nets is to train it on responses to writing prompts,using "long short-term neural nets", and then go from there; this tends to be a little bit better at creating stories with context, but they tend to be a bit vague (since they have a bias towards writing the most "probable" story)
    - What Professor Riedl is trying to research right now, then, is if reinforcement learning can be used to fix some of these problems by giving better rewards to "more coherent" stories
        - To figure out which stories make more sense, they try to use REWARD SHAPING graphs that reward the neural network if it uses terms commonly associated with the prompt (e.g. a LOT of reward if it uses the word "discover" in a story about marriage, only a little if it uses the word "convert" instead)

- So, if there's anything I want you to take away from that tangent, it's:
    1) You can generate stories!
    2) We didn't move from grammars to rules to machine learning because ML is any BETTER, but because it means we can get away with giving less information to the machine upfront before we can generate a story; it's another example of giving up control to save ourselves work!
        - Rule-based systems make very rigidly coherent stories, but they only say what we give them; ML systems create very diverse stories, but don't know how to give it structure
        - This is the SAME problem we've seen come up time and again in this class: human-generated vs algorithm-generated

- And, with that, I'm now contractually obligated to stop lecturing at you. 
Thanks for a good semester - and I'll see all of you (hopefully) on Friday!</pre>
