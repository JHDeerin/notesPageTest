//******************* Embodied AI - November 25th, 2019 *********************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Empty and broken, as Matt Maher says. I need to be picked up off the path again and continue to move and be moved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Alright, today we have a guest lecturer: Professor Dhruv Batra, who does research both at Facebook and with Georgia Tech on the Habitat AI project, using deep learning to enhance robotics with computer vision and language processing
    - Dr. Batra teaches the Deep Learning class here at GT
    - "Most of you have spent a semester learning about computer vision, but how do you train stuff with datasets? Let me tell you, change is coming!"
    - Currently, you download a bunch of images and run an algorithm on it; now, there's hopefully going to be a shift towards EMBODIED AI, with a physical agent taking actions in the world and getting feedback
        - This is a classic idea in robotics, and can also take the form of virtual assistants, etc.
        - "I claim that in the next 5-10 years this stuff will start making deep inroads into computer vision"
    - While embodied AI is a noble goal, there's a TON of classical problems with it: the proper hardware often doesn't exist, it's often too slow, it can be dangerous to have stuff running in the real world, the equipment is often expensive, and the research solutions tend to be VERY specific to each robot and don't generalize well to new environments
        - "I hope that the way to solve many of these problems is by using simulations - particularly photorealistic simulations and 3D datasets of environments"
    - Research into this has really started kicking off in the last 2-3 years, so it's an exciting time

- We'll talk about this in terms of 3D datasets, simulators, and tasks - let's start with datasets!
    - There's a startup company called "Matterport3D" that's basically trying to be Google Street View for your house by taking 3D scans and photos - and while it's currently geared towards real estate, it has a lot of implications for our purposes!
        - The 3D camera itself is actually relatively inexpensive
    - We can use this technology to generate initial datasets, taking 3D scans of houses

- We'll then use simulators, which are basically game engines (and sometimes actually ARE built off of game engines!) we've repurposed to let our agent simulate walking around different environments
    - Combined with our datasets, we can use these to train our agent and generate a bunch of data 
    - Common examples of this are DeepMind lab ("which isn't photorealistic at all, but does provide basic 3D navigation"), etc.

- Finally, TASKS are stuff we want our agent to actually do, like image classification, etc.
    - Currently, there are 3 big embodied AI communities: the computer vision people, the natural language people, and the robotics people
        - These fields have some overlap; vision and robotics people are often interested in navigation, vision and language people are interested in visual-based question answering ("how many napkins are on my desk right now?"), and robotics and language people are interested in "language grounding" (a bit abstract, but it basically means connecting disparate language symbols/images to some fundamental, concrete concepts)

- HABITAT is the project my team is working on, where we try to support generic 3D datasets, take those into a custom simulator for training many types of agents, and then use that to train agents to solve many different types of tasks
    - At Facebook, the Reality Labs team has built a set of 3D camera rigs that they can use to make photorealistic reconstructions of apartments - it even detects stuff like mirrors, etc. (although there are still small errors they're trying to work out)
        - Once we have this scan, we have a bunch of 3D meshes and textures, which we then go ahead and label as "wall," "chair," "mug," "door," "bed," etc.
            - Once these labels have been generated (either manually or otherwise), we can take images of this dataset in our simulator and automatically have them labeled as training examples for free!
    - Once we've got this dataset, we can plug it into our simulator - and as it turns out, most of the research being done in this field today is in video games
        - While this initially seems great, video game research and simulation research have very different goals: gamers care a lot about visuals and realistic looks, only need ~60hz performance, etc., while AI researchers need THOUSANDS of frames per second (so we can generate TONS of training images quickly), don't care about high resolutions, etc.
        - Dr. Batra's team built their own custom game engine optimized for speed called "Habitat-Sim," which can run at ~3000 FPS on a modern standard PC
            - As it turns out, the GPU isn't a bottleneck here, so they can run multiple separate instances of the simulator on a single GPU and generate 10,000+ images per second - "that's so fast that our SSD is actually the bottleneck for how fast we can load images"
                - "This means that we can generate an ImageNet sized dataset - with 1.2 million images - in about 3 minutes"
        - Why is this important, to have something this fast? Because having these faster simulators means we can run experiments that we simply couldn't before, 
            - Let's say we have a reinforcement learner that - given its direction to the goal, similar to if it had a GPS or compass - tries to map RGB frames to actions, and rewards the agent based on how close it gets to a randomized goal location (picking a random new apartment dataset for the test)
                - When Facebook originally compared this to existing algorithms, it fell significantly short of the classic SLAM algorithm for navigation, since they could only train on ~5 million frames of image data before the training times became impractical
                - With their simulator that could process 10,000+ images per second, though, they could train on up to 50 million images, and presto - we beat SLAM by ~10%!
                    - "Roboticists don't feel comfortable with us doing this, since we don't build any map of the house as we're running, which is deeply unintuitive to them"

- So, point-to-point navigation is one possible task we can do with our simulator, but there's a BUNCH more, and HABITAT hopes to support all of them!
    - Some examples of tasks:
        - Object navigation, like "robot, find my laptop in this house" when the robot's in an entirely different room
            - "This is much harder, since it's a search problem; we don't know where our goal is, so we have to find that first"
        - Embodied question answering, like "what color is my TV?"
    - The hope with Habitat is that - eventually - you can just pass it some configuration file about your task, and then it'll automatically handle training an agent for that goal
        - At CVPR this year in October, they ran a "Habitat Challenge Workshop" to try and refine this and get people using a pipeline of creating a simple python script for your agent, writing a Docker file to run this code on a container in any environment we want, and then sending it to "EvalAI" (missed what their purpose is?)
            - The research team from CMU won, by the way
    - The hope is that, eventually, Habitat can standardize the embodied AI pipeline and help make research in this area far more efficient

- So, how are people using this right now?
    - One really cool application that they're still writing the paper for is "Decentralized Distributed PPO," which is a reinforcement learning algorithm
        - The problem we're solving here is that, past ~200 GPUs, existing reinforcement learning algorithms (I think?) stop increasing linearly, so you have to add more and more GPUs to get the same increase in performance
        - This algorithm tries to push that boundary farther, letting training happen much more quickly for rich research institutions that can afford these GPUs (*cough* Facebook *cough*)
    - Just a few weeks ago, Google submitted a paper using Habitat testing how well virtually-trained agents in Habitat work when they're placed in real-world robots in real environments, and they found a correlation coefficient of ~0.875 compared to the agent's simulation performance - not perfect, but pretty good!
        - "It's worth noting that 1 second of simulation time takes ~40 hours of real-world time"
        - What this shows is that TESTING in the simulation is a reasonable analog of reality - "training in the simulation vs the real world is a separate topic that needs to be tested separately"
            - For instance, AI robots in the simulation tend to hug the corners, which fails to generalize if the real-world robot is larger than the simulated robot bodies ("they slammed into the wall corners all the time")

- So, other stuff!
    - I mentioned that we're scanning real-world environments, but we're also researching GENERATING artificial environments procedurally
    - Habit-Sim is currently completely static, and is basically just a mesh+texture renderer; we're working on implementing physics so the agent can work with that
    - Work is being done to get Habitat running on a browser to allow agents to collaborate and share data, and train on that (as well as allowing humans to give virtual feedback to the agent)

- Alright, that's embodied AI - if you're interested in working on this, apply to Facebook or to my research group! Besides that, have a happy Thanksgiving break!</pre>
