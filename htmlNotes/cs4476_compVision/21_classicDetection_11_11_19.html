//************ Classical Object Detection - November 11th, 2019 *************//
//**************************************************************************//

- "3 weeks ago, I was in Rome. Last week, I was in fake Venice in Macao...and it was actually a little depressing, especially with 3000 roboticists inside."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- So, last week we talked a bit about bag-of-words and KNN for object detection
    - Today, we're going to go even FURTHER bag and look at some classic techniques that've been outgrown today, but that I think it's valuable for you to know about
        - Support Vector Machines (SVMs) actually might be making a comeback, so stay tuned!
    - As a brief recap of last week, though:
        - Classification is when we have a bunch of training images that we want to use to teach a prediction function what an image is a picture of, usually by minimizing a loss function
            - "Make sure you NEVER test on a testing set; that's cheating, and has led to some earth-shattering scandals in the AI community"
            - There was one group that submitted a bunch of papers under different names to a conference, figured out what their different model's test errors were, and then used that to tweak their model. They won that competition...until they got caught, and shamed, and disowned (but evidently not forgotten)
        - These basic classifiers were the first pioneering attempts to bring machine learning into the field

- How can we use these techniques to detect faces in images?
    - Back in 1998, CMU wrote a pretty seminal paper on how this could be done reliably, and after a few years it got good enough to make it into quite a few consumer cameras
        - Originally in 2001, Viola/Jones hardcoded this class of detection using "Haar-Wavelet features," where a 24x24 region of the downsampled image was tested for some pretty basic features, like that a horizontal line where the eyebrows were should be darker than the cheekbones below
            - These actually weren't *quite* hardcoded; they set up the general class of features (adding/subtracting pixels in a filter), then let a learning algorithm find what the most informative things were

- Now, let's get into the classical stuff!
    - Wayyyyyy back in 1946, LINEAR CLASSIFIERS - or PERCEPTRONS - hit the field
        - The idea here is that we're trying to find a linear, straight-line/plane/etc. function to separate our data into different classes
            - That's great if our data is separable - but what if they're mixed together, or they're in a weirder shape to separate, like a spiral?
        - There may be multiple "cuts" that separate the data correctly, but as long as we find one that works, perceptrons don't care
            - For an "N" dimensional space, we need to define an "N-1" dimensional figure to cut it (for a 2D space, we need to define the 1D line, for 3D we need to define a 2D plane, etc.)
        - The algorithm for training perceptrons is pretty simple:

                Start with w, b = 0
                R = max(x_i)            # ???
                for i from 1 to N:      # Go through each example
                    if y_i(w*x_i + b) &lt;= 0      # If we misclassified the point
                        # Update the weights
                        w += learn_rate * y_i * x_i
                        b += learn_rate * y_i * R^2
                End once all examples are correctly classified

            - So, this algorithm will ONLY terminate if the data is linearly separable, which is definitely not guaranteed
                - Nowadays, you'd almost always replace this with gradient descent
        - Compared to KNN...
            - KNN is SUPER simple to implement (there's no learning!), it can handle non-linear boundaries, it works for any number of classes, and it's non-parametric (i.e. it remembers EVERYTHING)
                - HOWEVER, it needs a good distance function to work, and is slow
            - Perceptrons are low-dimensional and SUPER fast, but it only works for 2 classes, can be difficult to train, and requires linearly-separable data to work well

- BOOSTING, then, tries to deal with these issues by combining a bunch of weak learners together
    - The idea here is that instead of creating a single, super-accurate learner, we'll instead train a bunch of tiny, "weak" learners and combine their results
        - Perceptrons are a kind of weak learner; other kinds include "decision stumps" (very simple decision trees that just say "yes/no"), etc.
    - We'll then consider each of these learners (there may be thousands) as a feature of our boosting algorithm, and we'll go through several rounds of weighting these classifiers
        - For AdaBoost, instead of uniformly weighting them (which doesn't do as well as we'd like), we'll instead iteratively combine their results and train the weights for each classifier:

                h(x) = sum { a*h_i(x) }

            - This converges on a low training error VERY quickly; each iteration, we'll pick the best classifier we have so far, and when we make a mistake, we'll figure out what examples we mis-classified and give the learners that DON'T make those mistakes higher weights to compensate (I think??)
        - If we keep doing this, and adding more and more weak learners, we can show that the classifier'll tend to get better and better
            - Viola/Jones actually used this AdaBoost algorithm in their research, using it to find 200 different appropriately-weighted features
                - "I met Paul Viola recently - he's now a professor at MIT - and he's apparently doing work on (missed this)"
            - "I won't ask you detailed questions about this - it's been well surpassed by neural nets - but these historical results were surprisingly successful"

- Before we get to the last classical technique, we'll talk about a VERY relevant problem: PEDESTRIAN DETECTION!
    - Dalal and Triggs are 2 professors who hand-built an algorithm called HOG that did WAY too well on MIT's example pedestrian dataset, and so they decided to build their own INRIA dataset that had pedestrians in shadows, in crowds, etc.
        - Their previous algorithm worked in a similar way to SIFT, using gradient histograms to create descriptors of image features - and then, at the end, they threw it all into a linear SVM

- What're SVMs? They're SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES!
    - The idea behind these is that they're a linear classifier that tries to maximize the MARGIN between different classes (i.e. the distance of the decision boundaries from the closest examples in each class)
        - The intuition is that making our margins bigger will give us more room for error, but how can we express that mathematically for high-dimensional spaces?
            - To do this, we'll say the margin - the distance between our hyperplane and the closest points in either class - will be:

                    margin = min( (w/|w| * x_i))

                - ...where "x_i" is a given training datapoint and W is the vector PERPENDICULAR to our boundary; we're essentially taking the dot product to project the datapoint onto our perpendicular line, and taking the minimum
            - We'll then try to maximize this margin by finding the MAXIMUM margin for each possible boundary/vector we have (rotating/moving the hyperplane)
                - "10 years ago, we would've gone into much more detail on how to program this and constraint optimization and blah-blah-blah; now, I think it's just enough for you to understand the gist"

- Alright, we'll get on to better techniques next time!</pre>
