//********* Prefix Sum C Example / All-to-All - February 4th, 2020 **********//
//**************************************************************************//

- What glyphs shall grace the whitest board this morn?
    - Pause on project 1 discussion until Canvas comes back up
    - Example of prefix sum in MPI polynomials
    - All-to-all communication
    - Start thinking about sorting

- "On Canvas this morning, there was an announcement that said Canvas accidentally dropped ~3000 courses for random people across campus; fortunately, it seems most people in this class still submitted the project, but I'll wait until Thursday"
    - Also, you got your first programming project done! Congratulations!
- "Does anyone in the class have a USB-C to HDMI dongle? I forgot mine for once today, so the projector might get a break this class"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Last week, we went through some examples for how prefix sum can actually be used; today, we'll be looking at how to actually implement some of that via polynomials!
    - Polynomials as math functions are useful for approximation;

            f(x) ~= sum from i=0 to k{ a_i * x^i }

        - As we discussed last time, we need to compute powers of X to find this, which we can do using prefix-sum with multiplication as our operator
    - So, how can we do this in MPI?
        - In data, we have the following things:
            - A vector of coefficients a_0 ... a_k
            - A vector of X-values x_0 ... x_k (something about picking these?)
        - We then want to SOLVE for f(x_0) ... f(x_k), which is essentially solving for the following matrix:

                [x_0^0  x_1^0   (...)]
                [x_0^1  x_1^1   (...)]
                [(...   (...)        ]
                [               x_k^n]

        - So, how can we get a set of polynomials to use as our basis function (??)
            - We can use this set of polynomials called CHEBYSHEV POLYNOMIALS, which can be evaluated as a 3 term recurrence:

                    T_0(x) = 1
                    T_1(x) = x
                    T_n+1 = 2*x*T_n(x) - T_n-1(x)

            - How can we do prefix sum on this, based on last time with the Fibonacci sequence? Basically, we tried to turn this scalar operation into a VECTOR update operation:

                    [T_n(x)]    =   [0  1]   *  [T_n-1(x)]
                    [T_n+1(x)]      [-1 2*x]    [T_n(x)]

                    =&gt;  [T_n(x)]    = A^n   * [T_0(x)]
                        [T_n+1(x)]            [T_1(x)]

                - ...where "A" is our update matrix, raised to successive powers
        - How can we actually write this in C, using MPI? Well, I wrote up some code on GitLab that you can find here (https://gitlab.com/tisaac/chebyshev-live)
            - *Goes through the C code for a little while; I'll probably append the C code at the end of these notes*
            - A few sidenotes:
                - MPI_Scan is inclusive; MPI_Exscan is exclusive (something about Exscan being used when we only need to update previous stuff???)
                - For doing parallel I/O, where we want to print stuff on multiple threads, there are a few things we could do:
                    - We could have a "talking lock" where process 0 prints first, then releases the lock for process 1, etc.; however, we can still end up with them printing
                    - You could also have everyone send their information to a single process, and then have that process handle all the printing; this is good enough for simple cases
                - For receiving messages of an unknown size, we can use "MPI_Probe," which does (???)

- Okay, the last collective communication function we haven't looked at is "All-to-all" communication; let's do that!
    - ALL-TO-ALL means that each process has a custom message for each other process; we assume all of them are the same size
        - Essentially, we're "transposing" messages from each processor to the others; we want to go from:

                p0: [m00 m01 m02]
                p1: [m10 m11 m12]
                p2: [m20 m21 m22]

            - To:

                p0: [m00 m10 m20]
                p1: [m01 m11 m21]
                p2: [m20 m21 m22]

    - How could we implement this?
        - We could just have a loop in each of our "p" processes and have them loop through and send each of their "p-1" messages of length "m"
            - This is simple, but it has a problem: we send "p-1" messages to p0, then send "n-1" messages to p1, etc., meaning each process has to do "n-1" iterations of message-receiving and process ALL its received messages at each communication step before we can move on to the next one - not good!
                - This means the messages are interfering with one another, violating our permutation property (?)!
            - So, we could have p^2 communication rounds going on, with a time of:

                    O(t*p^2 + u*m*p^2)

                - Not great!
        - Instead, we could send these messages using our cycle shifts, where p0 sends to p1, p1 send to p2, etc., with "n-1" such rounds of communication, giving us:

                O(t*p + u*m*p)

            - This is way better - and since each message-passing algorithm has to process at least O(p) messages, it's asymptotically optimal!
            - BUT in the real, practical world, latency "t" is MUCH bigger than our bandwidth "u," so we want to minimize the number of our communication rounds (which we currently have "p" of)
        - To shorten the number of rounds, then, we'll use hypercubic permutations
            - Note here that the receiving process has to send BOTH messages it received to the next process, so we don't get the "log m" runtime (since while the number of messages is being cut in half each round, the message size is also doubling each round)
            - Therefore, we'll end up with a runtime of:

                    O(t*log(p) + u*m*p*log(p))

                - So, we're slightly sub-optimal in "u" runtime, but optimal for our latency term "t" - which for the real world is good!

- So, All-to-all is our most expensive "standard" communication primitive, but not ridiculously so; for arbitrary permutations, the runtime will be even worse at "O(t*p + u*m*p)"

- Let's say, though, that we don't have such a nice pattern, and instead we're trying to send many messages from SOME processes to some other number of processes, each of a different size - what can we do?
    - This is known as a MANY-TO-MANY communication, where we say "m_ij" is a message from process i to process j, and we assume the size of each message is &lt;= "S" (where a size of 0 means the message doesn't exist)
        - "R", meanwhile, is the largest size of a message we're receiving, and "R_i" is the largest message being received by process i
    - Unlike our other algorithms, there isn't a single "best" algorithm for many-to-many; some do well for sparse communication, while others do well for dense communications
        - One algorithm for it goes as follows:
            - In the 1st round, we split the messages each process has into parts and send part of each to P_0, P_1, etc. to get each message into equal-sized blocks, each &lt;= S/p
                - We can do this via an all-to-all in:

                        O(t*p + u*(S/p)*p)
                        = O(t*p + u*S)

            - In the 2nd round, we then want to re-route each of these message fragments to the final destination process (where they'll be re-assembled into the correct message); we can do that with an all-to-all with a max message size of R/p
                - This'll take O(t*p + u*R)
        - Together, these 2 steps give us a runtime of O(t*p + u*(R+S))
        - However, there's a question we haven't answered yet: after stage 1, how does each process know where to send each message fragment, and what size each one is?
            - To do this, we can include an O(p) extra bits to each message saying where each fragment should be sent (I think?), giving us new message sizes of "S/p + p" and "R/p + p", respectively
            - This gives us a new runtime of:

                    O(t*p + u*(R+S+p^2))

                - Or, if we make the common assumption that p^2 is O(S+R):

                    O(t*p + u*(R+S))

- Okay, we've looked at the communication times of all of these collectives and seen an example of using scan; next time, we'll break down Project 1 and start getting into the next class of problems we have: sorting!
    - "I'll bring all my adapters next time, too!"
