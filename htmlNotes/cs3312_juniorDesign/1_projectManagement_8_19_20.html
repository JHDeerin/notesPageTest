## August 19th, 2020

-   Okay, the teachers have discovered how to take attendance! HUZZAH!
-   "Hopefully Georgia Tech doesn't have to shut down like UNC; I went to UNC for grad school, so the news was actually kinda hitting me"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   So, the topic for today is "Project Management," which is really an ongoing thing you'll be doing the entire semester
    -   Hopefully you've done the readings for today, but if not, well, do that; the links are under the "Living Schedule" on Canvas

-   As you know, we're going with an Agile methodology to deal with changing requirements, etc., which is usually a better fit for CS projects than the much more structured Waterfall method, and lets us get working prototypes out earlier

-   There's an assignment on Canvas about your 6 main deliverables for this semester:
    -   Team Charter update
    -   Canvas Migration (move old minutes to new Canvas pages)
        -   Importantly, link your GitHub repo on this page - and use the EXTERNAL GitHub repository, not the internal GT one (since ZenHub doesn't work on private projects)
    -   Client charter update
        -   Make sure to add the sprint dates, etc.
        -   Also, prioritize your user stories from last semester; don't just think about what's easiest for YOU, but what's most essential for your client (so, leave account management stuff/etc. for later)
    -   Meeting minutes for each week
    -   Peer evaluations (CATME)
    -   Project tracking/execution (ZenHub, etc.)
-   You should have a completed client/team charter BEFORE Spring 1 ends; I would try to have them done THIS WEEK

-   A few things that we've noticed:
    -   Put someone in charge of managing the project and its different pieces; if you don't have this, its easy for people to ignore stuff and say "I thought you were going to do it!"

-   Okay, get to it!
