<pre class="main-note-text"># Team Retrospectives

## August 31st, 2020

-   Alright, hopefully you've started working on coding by now and are all going along
    -   If you haven't heard from your client by now, that's a HUGE issue and needs to get resolved ASAP
    -   If you haven't started coding, you should start working NOW! Your first sprint is going to be due THIS FRIDAY - so you need to start working NOW!
        -   Ideally, you should be working continuously across the whole sprint, not just piling it up at the end there
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Okay, we're going to talk about the sprint retrospectives you're going to be asked to do after you finish sprint 1
    -   Retrospectives are common after projects are done or for internships; they're where TOGETHER, as a team, you talk about the challenges you faced, what went well, what didn't, and what you want to improve on for the next sprint or project
        -   It's not a place to discuss technical issues or bugs you dealt with, usually; instead, it's specifically about TEAMWORK and how your team can do things together better
        -   Every course, we have 1 or 2 teams who focus on technical issues in their retrospective; we do NOT want that for your submissions! You can do that on your own as a team if that's helpful, but the one you submit to us should focus on teamwork issues
    -   These might seem cheesy, but you actually do learn quite a bit about your team from these, I think, so put the cheesiness aside and do the assignment
        -   You'll have to do 2 things for this assignment: a diagram, and a team memo
    -   We recommend a retrospective after each sprint, but you'll only have 2 graded ones this semester
        -   You can see all the details of the requirements you need to meet on Canvas

-   "I'd really recommend watching those videos I posted, read the rubric, and DO NOT TALK ABOUT TECHNICAL ISSUES!"
