//*************** User Stories - February 10th, 2020 *****************//
//**************************************************************************//

- (Missed the last class's notes due to computer issues; we generally covered the process of taking our detailed user statements.sketches, coming up with tasks to do, and deciding what the most important ones are for a minimum viable product (MVP))
- "My watch says to start, but common-sense says I should wait 'til 50% of the class gets here"
    - "Professor Stallworth is very nice and assumes you don't do the readings; I'm mean and assume you actually do work for this class"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Okay; today, we'll skim over the MVP process again, and go over user stories/acceptance criteria in terms of MVPs
    - In theory, you guys should've started brainstorming for the MVP stuff

- After creating your 2.5D sketches, you should start coming up with your product's minimum viable features
    - "Don't just record the features you choose to go with; record the ones you rejected, and WHY you chose to reject them, in case they ever come up in the future"
    - Eventually, you should come up with an MVP map of the most important features as "epics" with sub-requirements underneath them (ordered in importance from "essential" to "nice-to-haves" to "pie-in-the-sky goals")
        - After you've done this, for EACH one of these requirements like "Add Gmail sign-in," you should create a user story for that feature, along with a list of "acceptance criteria" of things that feature has to do from the user's perspective
    - You'll then plan which features you'll work on over a series of sprints

- Okay, that's the high-level view - but what's a user story?
    - A USER STORY is a description of a feature from a CUSTOMER'S perspective, with a set of accompanying ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA saying what that feature has to do in several different circumstances
        - "Sharing these with your clients is a great idea, so that they can correct you if you're building something wrong and so that they can see how well you understand their business"
    - User stories can come in a number of different formats, but the most common one probably looks like this:

            As a &lt;user type&gt;, I want to &lt;use feature&gt; so that &lt;some goal&gt;

        - For example, this might look like:

                As a website user, I want to register a new account so that I can monitor my banking expenses

            - "This might seem tedious, but listing all 3 of these things helps to remind you WHO has to use this feature and WHY it's important for someone - and if you have trouble thinking why it's important to a specific type of person, it might not be a feature you need!"
            - Also, try to make sure the goal is more specific than just "use feature;" saying "I want to track vehicles so I can monitor buses" doesn't give you ANY additional information about the user's goals
        - Your acceptance criteria can then be written as a bunch of scenarios in the following format: "Given _____, When _____, Then ____"
            - e.g.:

                    Scenario 1: A new user wants to register
                    GIVEN the user is on the registration page and hasn't already registered,
                    WHEN their name, email, and password is entered and the register button pressed,
                    THEN this user is added to the list of valid users

            - This helps us to decide when we've actually finished a feature to the USER'S satisfaction, instead of just stopping and saying "eh, this is good enough"

    - We only write user stories for in-scope features that you're actually going to implement - NOT for the pie-in-the-sky stuff, or even for far-off future sprints

- Okay, come up with your MVP table stuff and then finish your user stories! By!
