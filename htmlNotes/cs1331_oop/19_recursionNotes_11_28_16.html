//**************Recursion - November 28th, 2016************//
//********************************************************//

-We beat UGA! Apparently! That's a good thing! (I think?)
-Final is in 2 WEEKS; it will be ALL multiple choice to save Prof. Simpkins post-doc brain from grading, but DON'T THINK THAT MAKES IT EASY
----------------------------------------------------------

-We'll be going over recursion today, which'll be review for most, but is INCREDIBLY important

-EVERYTHING we cover this week - INCLUDING Stacks / Queues, Recursion, JavaFX, etc. - WILL be on the final
    -THE FINAL IS OPTIONAL - if you choose not to take the final, it WILL BE COUNTED AS AN EXCUSED ABSENCE - not a 0!!!!! Your grade will just be calculated as if the final never happened
    -You CAN'T come in, say "wow, that's hard!" and walk out of the final - once you come into the testing room, the grade will count
-Grades won't be rounded, so don't ask :P
-PLEASE fill out the Teaching Survey - it's anonymous, so be honest, but don't be too mean; CoC gets annoyed if not enough people participate. This might count as a 10pt assignment or something

-So, Recursion. Right. Recursion is cool.
-You probably learned about recursion as "a function that calls itself" - which is right, but not quite the whole thing.
-Formally, recursion is something that is defined using itself
    -We'll talk about 2 kinds: procedural and structural recursion

-Mathematics defines recursive operation, telling us how to "get" a recursive function
-This definition translates to the "how-to" of code pretty straightforwardly (usually); you need:
    1) A BASE CASE, where the recursion stops
    2) Some way of converging non-basic calls to the base case
        -Not following this results in an infinite loop, which is INFINITELY bad (results in a stack overflow error)

-A "strictly evaluated" language evaluates the values of something, THEN applies them to the function they're inside
    -this is CRITICAL in functional language, and is pretty important everywhere else

    SUBSTITUTION MODEL:
    -In practice, this is actually pretty simple; "factorial(5)" -&gt; "5 * factorial(4)" -&gt; "5 * 4 * factorial(3)" ...
    -Substitution model can be used for purely functional programming language, where there are no side effects - that is, we could replace the function with a value, and the program would still work fine

-Whenever a function is called/invoked, then an instance of that function is created in memory - in a place called "the stack"
    -this includes any local variables the function needs, etc.
    -This is called an "ACTIVATION RECORD", and each function needs its own "Stack Frame" to store its memory
    -BECAUSE OF THIS, recursive functions need their own local variables (e.g. for a "factorial" function, the call "factorial(5)" would generate a separate stack frame for factorial(5), factorial(4), factorial(3), etc.), so they can't use outside instance variables to store their results
        -This actually means its NOT A GOOD IDEA to use recursion to define a factorial function, since it needs to use a LOT of memory all at once to compute its result, rather than computing it in a bunch of small steps - meaning it can't compute this for large numbers
            -Could grow the stack, limit size, etc., but all of these are compromises and brittle

-Actually, ALL recursive functions can be replaced with loops
    the loop is basically a recursive function where the end of the loop is the base case, and the termination condition (e.g. value of i in for loop) is the convergence
-Often more natural

- Tail-Call elimination
-NOT Used by Java, but used in some other popular languages, notably functional languages (so won't be on the test)
-In our previous factorial example, the last operation in the function is multiplication - it's in the "tail position"
-Instead, if we have the RECURSIVE call in the tail position, something amazing happens - the stack doesn't expand!
    -Instead, the answer accumulates in a single variable over time
    -Works because now, with the recursive call last we don't have a function instance/Stack Frame "waiting" for an answer from the recursive call - instead, the compiler can just eliminate the previous recursive call and move on to the next one!
        -Sadly though, Java's compiler doesn't handle this :(
