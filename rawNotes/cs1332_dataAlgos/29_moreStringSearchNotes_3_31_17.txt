//************String Searching (cont.) - March 31st, 2017***************//

-Apparently there was a mildly catastrophic bridge failure on I-85, which means traffic in Atlanta has gone from "pretty insufferable" to "floodgates-of-the-dead" levels of crowded
----------------------------------------------

-Today, we'll start going over the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) String Search algorithm, and specifically TODAY, we'll be going over the KMP failure tables, which are HARD
    -"Even the TAs still struggle with these failure tables...they are NOT easy for students to learn"
    -We'll wrap up KMP next week, then we'll start going over graphs, which start out pretty easy but can get harder later on (minimum spanning trees, graph traversals, pathfinding, etc.)
        -"The most of graphs you'll see on Test 3 will be some simple traversal problems; nothing more"
        -Sorting will DEFINITELY be on the test, String searching will be there, but you aren't expected to code string searching (but you SHOULD be able to answer MC questions about it, and be able to trace the algorithms, know their performances, etc.)

-The KMP ALGORITHM searches strings by constructing a "FAILURE TABLE" (aka, a "failure function") to determine how much we should shift the pattern by when a mismatch occurs
    -In Boyer-Moore, we constructed the "Last Occurrence Table" during preprocessing
    -With KMP, the big idea is that we look at the beginning of the pattern and look for a "prefix" at the beginning of the pattern; we then go through the rest of the pattern and look for
-KMP starts searching from the beginning of the pattern; HOWEVER, when the pattern is shifted over, it may or may not start from the beginning again based on a few conditions

-The "Failure Table" is a table (usually an array) the same length as the pattern; each entry in the table contains a number representing the length of the longest "suffix"
    -e.g. in the pattern "revararev", the longest suffix that is also a prefix is "rev"
    -In the pattern "aba"
-KMP needs to know the length of the longest suffix for the [1] to [length - 1] characters in the string;
    -e.g., for "revararev", these would be:
        -re, rev, reva, revar, revara, revarar, revarare, revararev
        -So, in the failure table, [0] represents "r", [1] represents "re", [2] represents "rev", etc. (CHECK THIS??????)

-So, how do we make the failure table?
    -Create 2 markers, "i" and "j"; i points to the first character in the STRING (NOT at the table; the table is where we store the values, NOT what we're looking at), and j points to the 2nd character
        -In the table, set the 1st entry (for the 1st character) to 0, since it can't have matched any pattern that came before it
            -THEN, start going through and comparing the characters at i and j:
                1) If they are the same, write "i+1" into entry "j" for the failure table, and then move i and j BOTH forward by 1 character
                2) If they are DIFFERENT, and i is still at [0] (the 1st character), then set entry "j" to 0 and increment ONLY j
                3) If they are DIFFERENT, and i is NOT at the first character of the pattern, then reset i to the "i-1" entry in the FAILURE table
                    -Do NOT move j's position, and don't add any values to the table
            -Repeat until j passes the end of the string, meaning all of the entries in the table have a value

-So, that's...complicated, right? Let's go through some examples to try and clear things up a bit
    indices:    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
    pattern:    r e v a r a r e v
    failTable: (starts empty)

    -We start w/ i = 0, j = 1, and set fT[0] = 0
        pattern:    r e v a r a r e v
                    i j
        failTable:  0,
    -So, pattern[i] =/= pattern[j], and i = 0; so we say fT[j] = 0, and j++
        pattern:    r e v a r a r e v
                    i   j
        failTable:  0,0,
    -Now, still the same case as above, so we do the same thing
        pattern:    r e v a r a r e v
                    i     j
        failTable:  0,0,0
    -...and again, it's case #2
        pattern:    r e v a r a r e v
                    i       j
        failTable:  0,0,0,0
    -NOW, pattern[i] = pattern[j], so it's case #1; so, right now i = 0 and j = 4, and fT[j] = i + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1, and we then increment both i and j
        pattern:    r e v a r a r e v
                      i       j
        failTable:  0,0,0,0,1
    -Well, now pattern[i] =/= pattern[j], but i does NOT equal zero, so we're in case #3! SO, we say i = fT[i - 1] = fT[0] = 0; we do NOT edit the failure table, and we do NOT change j
        pattern:    r e v a r a r e v
                    i         j
        failTable:  0,0,0,0,1
    -Now, we have case #1 again; we know what to do
        pattern:    r e v a r a r e v
                    i           j
        failTable:  0,0,0,0,1,0
    -NOW, pattern[i] = pattern[j], so we have case #2! fT[j] = i+1
        pattern:    r e v a r a r e v
                      i           j
        failTable:  0,0,0,0,1,0,1
    -Same thing, pattern[i] = pattern[j], so we have case #2 again!
        pattern:    r e v a r a r e v
                        i           j
        failTable:  0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2
    -Case #2 again! Let's keep it going; fT[j] = i + 1, and remember, i = 2!
        pattern:    r e v a r a r e v
                          i           j
        failTable:  0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,3
    -...and j == pattern.length, meaning it's gone past the edge of the table, so we're done!

-So, that was a REALLY detailed example, but hopefully you can see how this works now!
    -Let's do another (just filling in the table):
        indices:    0 1 2 3 4 5 6
        pattern:    t h e a t h a
        fT:         0,0,0,0,1,2,0

-On Monday, we'll go through some more examples and finish showing how you actually DO the algorithm using this table
