//**************Last Lecture :( - April 24th, 2017*********************//
//********************************************************************//

-...it's actually comical how few people showed up today. From a class of ~300 people only about 20 actually bothered to come to the last class
    -Maybe HB's "By the way, no new test materials will be introduced on Monday" comment should've been held back for a few more days...
    -THE ROOM FEELS SO EMPTY
-So, thus far, only 1 TA has shown up, HB is nowhere to be found, there are literally less than 20 kids in a 300+ person lecture hall and it's already 9:08...
    -...annnnnnd the TA finally spoke up! "Sorry if you guys are waiting for lecture, but we decided to cancel today; I just realized HB forgot to make an announcement. Sorry about that."
        -_-

-This is the way the world ends
    -This is the way the world ends
        -This is the way the world ends
            -Not with a bang, but a whimper...
-ANNNNNNNNND that's a wrap, folks! Final's on Monday @ 11:30 in Clough 152 (this room); good luck and good day to you all!
