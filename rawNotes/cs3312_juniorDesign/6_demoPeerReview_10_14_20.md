# Demo Day / Peer Review

## October 14th, 2020

-   Okay, we're midway through October, over halfway through the semester, and today we're going to talk about the peer review you're doing for your detailed design doc
-   Also, info about the virtual expo: at least 2 people will be staffing a virtual booth at all times throughout the day, and you'll have an elevator pitch and a demo video prepared, as well as some sort of brochure/etc. to provide to people
    -   You'll need to have some of these materials prepared by November 9th; plan on presenting Monday from 10:00am - 12:00pm (let me know ASAP if no one from your team can make this time slot!)
    -   Remember, showcase the unique features of your project, NOT your amazing "login/logout" feature

-   Now, for the detailed design peer review: each team will be assigned another team's document to review
    -   Don't just critique their writing or their grammar: critique the content! Are the graphs not clear? Is what the system's doing confusing? Is it missing details?
    -   You'll each have a role when doing the review, and go over the document in those different pieces
        -   We're still figuring out what the best way is to do this review, but we'll let you know within the week, hopefully
