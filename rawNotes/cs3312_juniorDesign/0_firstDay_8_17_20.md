# The Very First Day of Junior Design (Again)

## August 17th, 2020

-   Ah, the screen-sharers are sharing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   "So, today we'll go over the basics, then leave you to reconnect with your team"
    -   Kathleen Schaag is our LMC instructor, and Fisayo Omojokun is our CS instructor
    -   The course is being run on a "living schedule" that may be updated at any time; the course'll be totally online
        -   "There's a Friday day for this course, but that's meant mostly for you to meet as a team, rather than for us to talk about anything"
    -   Why are you here, taking this course? To build the thing you designed last semester, following a sprint schedule
        -   We'll be trying to stick as close to industry as possible, with some flexibility because, well, you're students still in an academic environment
    -   Same required textbooks as last year (Alred & Charles's "Handbook of Technical Writing", and James Shore's "Art of Agile" e-book)
    -   We REQUIRE GitHub/ZenHub for project management tools, WHICH YOU WILL BE GRADED ON - we need to see a record of who's done what and when they've done it
        -   "As you should know, chances are that not following project management will mean your product won't get done, or will be missing certain things, or won't be what the client wants"
    -   Usual expectations: everyone should do an equal amount of work, non-conformers will be punished, communicate as a team, meet consistently, follow-up if you miss anything, stick to a work schedule, meet with your client regularly, accept that documentation writing is a part of your life, etc.
        -   "I won't read all these, but they are very good" - Fisayo says in a perfect monotone
    -   As far as grading goes, here's the breakdown:
        -   Detailed project design, 15%
            -   This is the main writing assignment this semester
        -   Sprint retrospectives/memos (2x), 10% total
        -   Video demo (3x), 15% total
        -   Final presentation, 15% total
            -   "We're still figuring out how the expo'll look"
        -   Project management (equal work, meeting minutes, etc.),  15% total
        -   Delivery docs (e.g. README), 5%
        -   Code review, 5%
        -   Reflective memo, 5%
        -   Client/instructor evaluation, 15%
    -   "You don't want your client to be surprised at the end, so try to keep meeting with them regularly and share your video demos with them at regular intervals"
-   This week, we DO have a Friday workshop when you WILL be meeting - sorry!

-   Schedule wise, there'll be 5 2-week sprints

-   If you go on Canvas, the LMC folks have organized the Canvas page into weekly modules; we may move some things around, but make sure to look through that stuff
    -   Also, be sure to re-look at your team and client charter, and this week start taking your user stories and put them into sprint plans, then send that to your client so they're on top of your schedule
        -   Of course things may change in your schedule, but this should give you a starting point
