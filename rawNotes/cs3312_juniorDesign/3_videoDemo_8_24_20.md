# Video Demos

## August 24th, 2020

-   "Is this the section with 35 people or 45 people?"
    -   "Too lazy...to...click Canvas..."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   "I don't expect us to meet for too long today; we're just introducing the video demos and project management"
    -   Last week, we talked about project management; we'd recommend using ZenHub, but you can be weird, too

-   So, the video demos - these are supposed to be short, 3-5 minute videos showing the work you've done over the sprint to your client
    -   The goal is to show your clients (and us professors!) that you're actually getting things done, in video form
    -   They should typically have an introduction to the team, then an introduction to the project ("give a title slide or something, to remind us what team you are")
        -   Show us the iteration plan, and the user stories you got done this sprint
        -   What if you don't have flashy UI stuff, just some code? If possible,restructure your iteration plan so you can show the UI stuff each sprint; if not, show what you think your client will be interested in
    -   Importantly, if your client DOESN'T like something, take their feedback into account and fix it! That gets you MASSIVE props with your client!
-   The full video rubric is on the Canvas site
    -   If you had something planned for this sprint that you didn't get done, MENTION THAT and explain why it wasn't done!
    -   "You should rehearse, but we're not expecting perfect YouTube stardom; as long as the video is organized and clear and semi-professional, we'll be lenient"
    -   Your video should be streamable without having to download anything; YouTube is fine

-   Remember: your audience for these videos are the client (who'll be looking for the specific features they want, and might show it to other people) and us professors (who'll be looking for completeness and the stuff in the rubric)
