# Reflective Memo

## November 16th, 2020

-   Live demo might look different from the video; that's okay!
-   Remember, the expo is NEXT WEEK, so be prepared for that!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Now, wayyyyyy back in the Spring, you had a reflective memo that had team components and individual components; you'll be doing the same thing with your team this semester
    -   Only the instructors will see this memo, so please be transparent as a team: talk about how you actually did your work and explain what you did well, what didn't go well, if you had any problems with your client, etc.
    -   Keep in mind your team members WILL see this assignment, so leave complaints about team members to CATME
    -   You need to choose 3+ categories to focus on for your retrospective, just like for the Spring; doing the same categories as in the Spring might be helpful
        -   Make sure to be detailed and specific with your examples, and make sure to give concrete ways that you would improve things
    -   The NEW part of this semester is that you have some sort of collaborative what wnet well/what didn't process; you can do whatever you want for that, but the balloon format might make sense, since you've done that before
    -   You then do the individual reflections, where you have to choose 2 categories
    -   "Make sure to use headings, and make this memo "

-   Most reflective memos are 3-5 pages

-   So, let's look at the living schedule to see what's coming up:
    -   Your final detailed design doc is due on the 18th, this Wednesday evening - DON'T FORGET THAT!
    -   You have your last meeting minutes due on the 20th
    -   Customer delivery doc is due this Sunday, the 22nd; make sure your install instructions are clear, especially if your customer isn't technically skilled
    -   Expo is on the 23rd
    -   The reflective memo is due on the 24th
-   The "project management" grade is really just the cumulative of your meeting minutes, status reports, your GitHub setup, etc; you shouldn't have to do anything extra for that
