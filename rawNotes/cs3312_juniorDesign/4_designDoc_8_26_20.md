# The Design Doc

## August 26th, 2020

-   There's been some shifting around on Canvas; the Project Management project used to just be one giant project, and now we're breaking that up into multiple stuff (charters, meeting minutes, etc.)
-   Another announcement: there will be a VIRTUAL EXPO!
    -   It'll be using the same software as the career fair this year, so hopefully all the kinks'll be worked out by the time they get to us
-   The detailed design document is the main writing assignment this semester
    -   It'll be split among several different assignments; it'll basically be a living document, where you have a design doc page on your Team Project site
        -   The first part is due on September 9th; you aren't writing the whole thing, just the beginning
    -   This document DOES actually help you with planning, so try to do it well!
-   No class on Friday, so meet; on Monday, we'll be talking about the next thing, the retrospective assignment
