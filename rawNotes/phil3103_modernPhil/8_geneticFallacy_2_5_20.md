## February 5th

- There were no pre-class scribblings today, except for a battered drawing of a cake that looks like it has either sprinkles or smallpox (it's quite hard to tell)

- Okay; there's an assignment due SUNDAY for your 1st argument analysis on Descartes
    - The 1st question is about what Descartes thinks the substance, or "essence," of the mind/real world is (*especially* in Meditation 6)
- There's also a reading next week from Newton and Leibniz; we're doing the first 2 Newton letters AND Leibniz's "Letters to Clarke"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Okay, I've gotten some questions about psychological motivations for arguments; "Isn't Descartes motivated by his religious beliefs? So why should we take what he says seriously?"
    - It's a serious point, but logically that's NOT a good critique - it's something called the genetic fallacy!

- So, what makes an argument "valid?" Let's review!
    - An ARGUMENT is a series of statements that lend support to a conclusion
    - A VALID argument is one in which those statements - "premises" - are actually connected to the conclusion. If the premises are true, the conclusion *must* be true!
        - ...notice the "if" here; a valid argument, logically-speaking, doesn't mean its premises are ture, bot only that IF they are true then they would help show the conclusion is also true
        - (fish example from the handout)
    - Here's an INVALID argument
        - (puppy example on handout)
    - An argument can be valid, but still untrue, because the premises could be wrong - meaning the argument is UNSOUND!
        - A SOUND argument is one that is valid with true premises

- However, we can also have FALLACIES: common ways of making bad arguments or logical errors
    - The GENETIC FALLACY is a "fallacy of irrelevancy," where the objection doesn't actually deal with the truth of the premises
    - Specifically, this is where we reject an argument because of its origin (e.g. who's making the argument) - they're making a premise that doesn't lead to the conclusion "this argument is false"
