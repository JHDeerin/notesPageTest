# Physical Activity (cont.)

## October 1st, 2020

-   TODO: Read the slides and then fix this; the lecturer was going pretty fast
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   So, we covered some physical fitness stuff last lecture, but let's keep going!
    -   When you start exercising, you don't to just say "I want to get more fit, somehow;" you want to set goals - and you specifically want to set SMART goals:
        -   SPECIFIC
        -   MEASURABLE ("I'll improve my mile running time by 1 minute")
        -   ACTION-ORIENTED ("I'll meet with my fitness trainer", have a clear action to take)
        -   REALISTIC
        -   TIME-ORIENTED (give yourself enough time to meet the goal)
    -   You also want to use the FITT principle to design your workouts; for cardiorespiratory fitness
        -   Measure your FREQUENCY; this should be ~3-5 days per week for cardio
        -   Measure your INTENSITY, such as via measuring your heartrate (should be ~64%-96% of your maximum heartrate), V02 (volume of oxygen in your blood), or RPEs (ratings of perceived exertion)
        -   Your TIME should be ~20-30 minutes per day, in one long bout or multiple shorter bouts
        -   The TYPE should be rythmic, continuous movements of large muscle groups that's sustained for at least 20 minutes
    -   For muscular stength/endurance, you should also use the FITT
        -   For muscle gains, the frequency should be 2-3 days per week (or 1 day for maintenace); you should allow 2 days for recovery
        -   Intensity should be at least 8-12 reps (more, lighter reps for endurance training)
        -   Time should be <60 minutes
        -   For the TYPE, you should decide what muscles you want to work out and vary which ones you hit
            -   HYPERTROPHY is when your muscle cells increase in size, while HYPERPLASIA is when your number of actual muscle cells increases
                -   Hypertrophy is where most of these gains come from

-   A total exercise program involves warm-up stretches, endurance training, then resistance training, then a cool-down/stretching period ("this is CRUCIAL for avoiding injuries")
    -   FUNCTIONAL TRAINING is when you try to improve specific, everyday tasks you want to do

-   To exercise, though, you need fuel from nutrients, and there are 3 big nutrients you need
    -   CARBOHYDRATES are stored as glycogen in the muscles/liver; it's converted to glucose to generate ATP, and it's the primary substrate your body uses up during exercise
    -   FATS are stored in large amounts in the body; they have a high ATP yield (2x that of carbs), but are released more slowly (usually during prolonged exercise)
    -   PROTEINS shouldn't be the primary substrates during exercise, and are used up last
        -   You should eat ~20-25 grams of protein for muscle growth, and ~20g every few hours for protein synthesis (which increases after resistance training)
-   Besides these, you also need fluids to let your body make sweat and cool you down
    -   You also NEED electrolytes after a workout (especially sodium and chloride)
        -   ...although you do lose some potassium as well
    -   In general, you should drink ~5-7ml of liquid for every kilogram of body weight 4 hours before your workout, and you should replace however much body weight you lost with water
        -   Don't drink TOO much water, though, as that can result in hyponutremia (i.e. water poisoning, too diluted)
-   You should wait 3-4 hours after a large meal to exercise so your body can finish digesting your food for energy
    -   For meals, you should be eating carbohydrates and proteins, and avoiding fatty foods
    -   You should have ~3:1 ratio of carbs to proteins for "exercise fuel"
-   AFTER exercising, though, you should eat something small ~30-45 minutes afterwards, and eat a full meal within 2 hours

-   In general, you should eat more proteins and less carbs/fats to lose weight

-   Another important thing: SLEEP!
    -   If you don't sleep enough, you'll be craving more sugar and fats, and less than 5 hours of sleep per night can be really harmful to your health
    -   Genetics/gender is huge (men put on muscle easier), experience knowing how to exercise, high stress/cortisol levels will break down muscle, etc.

-   We should also talk about injuries while exercising
    -   There's 2 big types: OVERUSE injuries (gradually tearing your muscles due to repeated use), and TRAUMATIC injuries (torn all at once due to an accident, e.g. breaking a bone)
        -   The most common overuse injuries are "runner's knee," plantar fasciities, and shin splits
    -   To prevent these, wearing proper footwear/clothes, and using equipment properly, is important
    -   To treat an injury, remember RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation

-   Some special things to know about when exercising in extreme conditions
    -   In hot climates, watch out for HEAT CRAMPS (involuntary muscle contractions resulting from not enough fluids/electrolytes) and HEAT EXHAUSTION (blood pooling in extremities away from your brain, making you feel nauseous; this can develop into life-threatening HEATSTROKE, where the body's cooling mechanisms fail and can cause brain damage and bright red skin)
    -   In cold climates, you can have HYPOTHERMIA when the body cools down below 95 degrees (and below 90, your body's heating mechanisms like shivering start shutting down)
        -   Wearing proper clothing and starting off with light exercise in new environments is important

-   Right now, 18-25, you're at your peak bone mass; as you age, your risk of fracture increases, so you should be increasing your BONE MINERAL DENSITY (BMD) by doing weight/resistance training and getting Vitamin D and calcium in your diet

-   Also, avoid OVERTRAINING, where training too much can actually result in lowered hormones, higher levels of stress, and a weaker immune system from increased cytokines
    -   This is especially important before competitions, so Olympic athletes will often rest and move to light workouts anywhere from 4 to 28 days before major competitions
