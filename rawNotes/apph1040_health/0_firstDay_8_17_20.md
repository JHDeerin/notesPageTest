# The Start of Health

```
In rooms of unimagined distance
apart they are and I with them
fingerless and tongueless only
eyes and ears to lend

Waiting for what's dreaded only
hoped abstractly into being
the teacher and half-willing pupil yoked
upon the barren screen
```

-   So...many...technical difficulties...
