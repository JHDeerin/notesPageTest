# Physical Activity

## September 30th, 2020

-   So, physical activity is important - why?
    -   It helps prevent cardiovascular and other diseases
        -   Lack of phsyical exercise is one of the big 4 reasons for preventable death
    -   It helps with mental illnesses, too
    -   Some immediate benefits:
        -   It reduces your stress level
        -   It improves sleep schedules
        -   It helps you to concentrate (it literally flows more blood to your braim)
        -   It improves your self-esteem
        -   Improves your resistance to mental and physical diseases
    -   Physical activity, though, is ANY body movement that enhances your health, while exercise is a specific type of PLANNED physical activity specifically set aside for your health
        -   As Americans, only 50% are meeting the 2008 U.S. physical exercise guidelines, only 24% are meeting aerobic and strength guidelines, and ~26% engage in no execise at all
            -   What are these guidelines? We're supposed to get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity EACH WEEK!
                -   Moderate intensity would be a heartrate of ~60-75% of your maximum heartrate, vigorous exercise is at ~75-95%
            -   The formula for your target heartrate USED to be:

                ```
                lower limit = 0.64*(220 - age)
                upper limit = 0.96*(220-age)
                ```

            -   Now, the updated formula replaces this with 207 - .7*age
                -   So, for a 20 year-old, you'd be looking at a 124-186 BPM target range
                -   "Being in this range is important because physical activity that's below the moderate level tends to have noticeably less benefit for cardiovascular activities, although it's still way better than nothing"
                    -   REMEMBER: These are general
            -   Another way to tell your heart rate: if you can talk comfortably but not sing, it's a moderate activity; if you can only talk in short spurts, it's a vigorous activity

-   There are 5 basic kinds of physical fitness:
    -   CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS is your ability to sustain an activity for an extended period of time
        -   These are "aerobic" activities that rely on the heart/lungs providing oxygen to the body, like running, stair climbing, etc.
    -   MUSCULAR STRENGTH is how much force a muscle is capable of exerting in a single contraction
    -   MUSCULAR ENDURANCE is how well your muscles can do something repeatedly
    -   FLEXIBILITY is your range of motion around a given joint
        -   "This is often blown off, but it's important for preventing injuries - runners can prevent tons of injuries just by stretching"
    -   BODY COMPOSITION is the ratio of your fat to muscle in your body tissues
        -   Your body composition can ABSOLUTELY change even if your weight doesn't, since you can replace muscle with fat or vice-versa

-   So, regular physical activity gives us less risk of cancer/diabetes/heart diseases/etc., reduces osteoporosis, leads to longer life and better immune systems, etc.
    -   Reducing cardiovascular diseases comes from literally making your heart and lungs stronger muscles and more efficient, having increased "stroke volume" and increasing the amount of oxygen and bloom pumped
        -   It also comes from reducing hypertension (which is a big cause of stroke and heart attacks), and improves your blood lipids (increases HDL (high-density lipoprotein, "good cholesterol"))
        -   Exercise improves your immune system, too, by increasing your number of white blood cells and reducing body inflammation
    -   It reduces metabolic syndromes like type 2 diabetes and accompanying heart problems (high blood pressure, obesity, high levels of bad carbohydrates, impaired blood sugars)
        -   Exercise reduces obesity and burns excess calories, which helps with ALL of these
        -   "For weight loss, you should double how much exercise a normal person needs, i.e. 300 minutes of exercise per week, especially via high-intensity interval training where you alternate high-intensity workouts with moderate ones"
            -   Different activities burn different amounts of calories; 30 minutes of 3 MPH walking only burns 120 Calories, as opposed to 230 when walking at 4.5 MPH, or 400 when jogging
    -   Exercise prevents osteoporosis (i.e. low bone density) by increasing your bone mass via weight-bearing activities; higher bone density also increases hormone levels in both men and women
    -   Exercise improves mental health by reducing stress and anxiety, making sleep easier, improving depression, and ; people also tend to report higher self-esteem and energy levels after exercising
        -   Stress in particular is reduced by the body releasing neurotransmitters related to from exercise
        -   By getting more oxygen flowing, too, exercise even helps with focusing and thinking
    -   Finally, there seems to be a link between people who exercise and reduced risks of cancer

-   Remember, diet is HUGE when it comes to keeping these benefits; you need a LOT of exercise to burn off a 300 Calorie latte, and removing those things from your diet can make a surprisingly large difference

-   Now, how much you exercise and how you exercise is going to vary from person to person - "you do NOT want to go from not exercising at all to doing 300 minutes of high-intensity stuff all at once"
    -   If you haven't been exercising at all, start gradually by slowly replacing sedentary behaviors with walking or moving around more
        -   You should also start exercising your muscles with simple, low-weight exercises and getting used to proper techniques, as well as stretching to keep yourself safe
    -   When you're picking physical activities, you should pick things that are convenient and that you enjoy - if you hate the gym, go for a walk instead!
        -   "The best exercise is the one that you'll actually do for more than a few weeks!"
        -   If you can incorporate exercises into what you already do, too, that's a great way to get started; walk to class instead of taking the bus! If you're okay with looking strange, do squats when you're in line at the supermarket!
    -   Think about what your obstacles are to working out, like not being motivated or disciplined, not enjoying it, not having time or resources, etc. - then, come up with ways to overcome those
        -   If you have motivation issues, work out with friends! If you don't have time, incorporate exercise into your normal routines!
