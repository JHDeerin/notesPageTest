//*************** Final Report Overview - March 11th, 2020 ******************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Okay, we're possibly closing for coronavirus, but that's okay - this class will carry on, rain or shine or sneezes!
    - For your paper prototype reports, I thought most of the reports could've used more images, some of the reports skipped explaining your project background/what your tasks were (which is helpful for me understanding the rationale behind your changes), and so forth
        - Also, while I haven't been docking for this, PLEASE cite the peer evaluations you got from your own team members and from other teams
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Now, while this class is by no means "done," we've gone through most of the deliverables leading up to the final prototype, and that means today we'll introduce the final report you'll need to start working on when you get back from spring break
    - "Hopefully a LOT of this should look familiar and be reusable from your past work with minor tweaking (do NOT use the entire thing, but copy the relevant sections), but there are some new things, so pay attention"
        - We want these reports to be good - not just well-written, but if they're particularly strong you can show recruiters what you did for a semester and provide a definitive account of what you did this semester, and why you chose to do what you did; it's also SUPER helpful for getting you up to speed when you come back in the fall, and if team members have to leave this'll save you a lot of time getting new people up to speed
            - "You do NOT have time to figure out what you're doing when you get back for Part 2, so do the planning now and hit the ground running later"
            - With that in mind, you can't assume the people reading this report know your background, and to help make this report good we have you turn in an initial draft that we give you a LOT of feedback on, and then a final draft
        - The parts of the report are as follows:
            - Cover page (title, date, team members, etc.)
            - Table of Contents (lists all your page numbers)
            - List of tables in the report
            - List of all the figures/images in the reports
            - A glossary
                - This is where we start hitting the "I need to imagine what the audience knows" barrier; you don't have to explain what a "computer" is, but if you're creating a health app you might want to define "POS" as "point-of-service," and you might have to define terms like "API" if you know
                    - There are some fringe stuff, like defining "MySQL" (because it's not project specific), but in general err on the side of having too many terms than too few
            - Abstract (describe your project and explain WHY IS IT NEEDED)
                - "I'm like you; I don't actually want to read all of this stuff, so if you've bored the heck out of me with your first paragraph I'm not going to be nice to the rest of your paper. The actual paper introduction should convey your passion, while the abstract - while it can be that - should have less flair and be more straightforward. HOWEVER, it needs to make the stakes immediately clear and get straight to the point: what's your project for, why should I care, and what did you do about it? It's an abstract, so it shouldn't explain EVERYTHING, but it should give your main "
            - Introduction
            - Minimum Viable Product
                - You've already done this, but justify WHY these features are your minimum, most important ones
            - Ethical Considerations
                - This is a new section, but we want you to tell people what ethical considerations you need to think about (BELIEVE ME, your project has some), and provide support for what course of action you're taking to address them
                - "Develop the part of you that asks the question 'should we be coding this at all?', because not enough people ask it; how could your app affect people's privacy? Society as a whole? People's perceptions?"
            - Data Flow
                - "DON'T TALK ABOUT LOGIN SYSTEMS; we know how these work. Tell us what's unique in your project that actually needs explaining"
            - Technology
                - This is where you describe what technology you're choosing to build the application with, and again, justifying WHY you chose them using secondary sources
                - "You can kind of pull the wool over my eyes here, but if you do your job right you'll be able to explain your reasons to me and make even non-technical people understand your choices"
            - Fall Plan
                - Give a narrative and a schedule for how you're going to successfully build your project in Fall 2020, specific enough that we know what you're doing your first week
                - We're especially looking for 2 parts: a communication plan of how you'll get back in touch with your team, the client, etc., and a management plan for when you'll begin coding, how you'll adapt to delays or features requests, etc.
            - Sprint Schedule
                - Using your MVP map, what are you planning to work on when you get back in the Fall? What schedule are you planning?
            - Appendix
                - Here, include your past work in full like:
                    - MVP map
                    - User stories/acceptance criteria
                    - Complete flow chart
                    - Complete flow sketches
                    - Paper Prototype
            - Bibliography
                - As per usual, CHICAGO STYLE!

- "Some people write this whole report like a narrative - 'we made this decision, then we did this, then we did...'; that's not always the best move"

- Alright, have a wonderful break, don't forget your digital prototype report is due on Friday, and have a good day!
