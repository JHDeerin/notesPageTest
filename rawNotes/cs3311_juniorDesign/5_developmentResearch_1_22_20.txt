//************* Development and Research - January 22nd, 2020 ***************//
//**************************************************************************//

- The attendance cards are still un-printed, and thus must be sad at their unfulfilled purpose
- "If you haven't gotten a response from your client, that's just proof you didn't add enough GIFs to it"
    - In some cases, you might've gotten an email saying "hey, I'm not the actual client, I'm just the go-between" - that's a little weird, but not too uncommon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Today, we'll start talking about secondary research for your projects - and, for today specifically, getting into the research vocabulary and talking

- First, though, 4 things that commonly came up when I was reviewing the client emails:
    - For meeting times, I'd recommend keeping them purely in business hours (Monday - Friday, 9 to 5); this protects both of your times, and generally looks more professional
        - If you CAN'T meet during those times, then you can stretch it a little bit, but in general you don't want to meet on Saturdays or at 8pm or anything like that
    - Specify WHAT kinds of meeting you'd like - in-person or video call? Where do you want to meet them?
    - Be SPECIFIC about meeting times; don't just say we'll "meet in the afternoon" or something like that, and in some cases (not in this class) you might have to specify time zones
    - Search your clients up on Google - verify what their titles are ("Dr." or gender or marital status and such), get some context, etc.
        - When addressing women and their marital status is unclear, lean towards "Ms." most of the time

- Okay, let's get to today's stuff!
    - From the reading last night, there are 3 kinds of project developments you could be doing:
        - PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT means you're developing a project for your own team
        - IN-HOUSE CUSTOMER DEVELOPMENT means you're making a project for a separate part of your own organization OR an organization that you have ready access to, meaning you aren't as familiar with their needs, but you still have relatively easy access to the users you're making things for
            - This has a little bit of separation and communication difficulties
            - "Remember the team that got fired? One of the big reasons the client was mad was because the client gave them contacts to work with people within the company to follow-up with and get access to the customers"
        - OUT-SOURCED CUSTOMER DEVELOPMENT means you're developing a project for an outside client, meaning you have less access to your customers for feedback, etc.
            - This is probably the most common type of project, and means that there are especially large challenges with getting feedback and communication
    - One of the BIG pitfalls teams can fall into is treating an outside project as a "personal development" project, where you listen primarily to your own team because it's "easier" rather than trying to make an application based on client feedback

- In addition, there are 2 kinds of research you'll have to do for ANY project
    - PRIMARY research means you're doing your own direct observations (autobiography, interviews, field observations, surveys, user studies, etc.), while SECONDARY research is based on reviewing previously-done research or data (e.g. statistical research on already-collected data, summaries of existing papers, etc.)
        - In an ideal world, we'd have you all do primary research - and there are some, like UX studies, you could do - but oftentimes you might be limited in your access to the clients, or require IRB approval for many types of studies
            - "IRB, or Institutional Review Boards, are a gigantic pain where Georgia Tech has to approve any proposed faculty research to make sure it's legal, ethical, etc."
                - Historically, these originated after some severely traumatic experiments like Stanford Prison, Milgram's shock experiment, the Tuskegee Syphilis experiment, Nazi human experimentation, MKUltra ("the CIA giving people LSD without telling them what it was to see if it worked as mind control"), etc.
                - This led to the Belmont Report, which required any proposed research to pass a slew of criteria like respect for persons (informed consent, no deception, etc.), beneficence (minimize risks to subjects AND there's good reason for your research), and justice (procedures are administered fairly within reason)
            - Because of that, we'll expect you to do a large dose of secondary research for your projects
        - "Side note: don't talk to ANY children for this class for ANY reason, or you risk a gigantic slew of lawsuits"

- Okay, on Friday we'll get into the research we expect YOU guys to do - come one, come all then!
