- *Professor Shelley in a full suit, Professor Stallworth in a T-shirt and blue jeans*: "...there's a slight contrast in the way we look right now"
    - "Also, Hi Roland's Mom!" - Dr. Professor Jonathan Shelley, embarrassing his students
    - "...if we bring back Roland's mom, will she make us cookies?"

- Alright, we're trying out using BlueJeans to run online classes for the rest of the semester, due to our coronavirus mini-apocalypse

- We've made some (hopefully small) changes to the syllabus, and'll just run through those today
    - On the 25th, we'll go over some helpful dataflow stuff for your final reports
    - On the 30th, we start lectures again in earnest; the initial final report is due April 3rd (a little less than 2 weeks from now); after you turn those in, we'll schedule video meetings with each team the following week to discuss those
    - There'll be a "Reflective Memo" due on the 20th
    - The revised Final Report will be due April 29th, and while we WERE going to do YouTube final presentations, we decided to scrap that due to the difficulty of collaborating on videos remotely
    - One new thing: if you haven't gotten all of your participation cards out, you can do a "Vintage Final Report Critique" where you can view final report drafts from previous semesters and our feedback on them; each one of these has some associated activity you can do for credit
        - "Again, if you've already finished all your participation quota stuff, this last assignment is optional - although it does give you some insight into what we're looking for in the final reports"

- "I'm expecting some server in the nation somewhere to blow up at any time, and plunge our country into chaos...well, more of it, at least" - Professor Stallworth

- "That's all we have OH...class registration, that's right!"
    - All of you should've received a message on Canvas called "Course Updates and Registration Instructions for Junior Design Part 2"; each of you should individually fill out a form with your name and preferred time, and once she sees everyone on a team has submitted the form with the same timeslot, you'll get a permit to sign up for your given Junior Design questions

- All right, stay safe out there, and I'll see you guys again on Wednesday!
