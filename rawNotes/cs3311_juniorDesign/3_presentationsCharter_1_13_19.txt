//*********** Presentations / Team Charter - January 13th, 2020 *************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Alright - let's pull up a random number generator, get your team names, and get this project-bid-presentation show on the road!
    - I'm going to videotape you for grading purposes
- *First team also had the "2 people present, 1 intro, 2nd technical aspects" idea*
    - Another team presented for the CDC malaria project! Our team probably had the better presentation, but the other team sounds equally qualified, so I'm not sure who'll get it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Okay, so after this class Professor Stallworth and I will take your presentations and emails, meet with the other section professors, and try to assign each team one of their top 3 by this Wednesday
    - Our goal is to get everyone their 1st choice; if that isn't possible, we try to match up the projects based on the expertise you outlined in your emails, and then to try and get you your 2nd choice, and so forth

- With that, your next document is to try and send your 1st email to your clients by this Saturday!
    - Some clients are very responsive and get back right away, while others can unfortunately be slower and take up to a week to get back to our teams

- What is MUCH more in your control is your team charter, which your team will have to make together; some of it is quite obvious, while others will require your team to come up with your own guidelines for meetings, submissions, how to divvy up work, how to deal with non-helping teammates, etc.
    - These aren't fun things to think about, but they're necessary
    - "I find that the teams that tend to have problems are also the ones who don't seriously give this document thought, about what they expect from one another in terms of attendance, performance, and the like"
    - You have all the tools to start doing this; the only thing you can't put into the charter yet is the project name
        - A note: for the "team roles" part, you have a reading on Wednesday that goes over some common roles you can have in your team
        - "Obviously you can help with stuff outside of these roles, and you CAN choose to have combination roles where team members take multiple roles on throughout the semester or rotate responsibilities, etc., but you'll be expected to definitely do your role's stuff when you've got it"
    - Definitely make sure you have set policies for if someone has a busy week and can't finish their work, etc. - try to imagine what challenges could come up or have come up in previous team projects
- "In a sense, this is the worst time of the semester for me to ask you to make this, since you guys haven't gone through these rough scenarios as a team yet"

- Okay; on Wednesday, we'll look at 2 example charters and talk more about this stuff. See you then!
    - "Sample 2 is meant to be a bad example, while sample 1 is a better example of how you should do things"
