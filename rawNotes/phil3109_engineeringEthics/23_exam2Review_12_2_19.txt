//**************************************************************************//

- Okay, it's the last class!
    - The final is taking place THIS FRIDAY, December 6th, in this room at 11:20am
    - The exam will be NON-CUMULATIVE, and'll be a similar format and length as the midterms (i.e.a mix of multiple-choice and short, 2-3 sentence answers)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- With that, let's start going over what'll be on the 2nd exam!

- First up, stuff from ALBERT BORGMANN, including:
    - Borgmann was this philosopher of technology
        - DEVICE PARADIGMS were probably his most important idea
        - Machinery vs commodity
        - Paradigmatic Consumption (in that article we read)
        - Focal things / Practices
        - General philosophy of technology stuff, like technological determinism, utopianism, dystopianism, and instrumentalism
            - "This is honestly some of the hardest stuff we covered, in part because it was just so darn long ago"

- We then talked about another tech philosopher, DON IHDE
    - He's a "phenomenologist" - what's that?
    - "Prognostic predicament"
    - Multistability (what is it? Why does he mention it?)
    - He also talked about 3 ways people approach technology, which we talked about in lecture:
        - Embodiment relationships
        - Hermeneutic relationships
        - Alterity relationships

- Also mentioned: psychological impediments to ethical thinking for engineers!
    - The Problem of Many Hands
    - Blind spots (a few different types)
    - Normalizing deviance
    - Egoism / egocentrism
    - Microscopic vision
    - Uncritical deference to authority (Stanley Milgram)
    - Groupthink
        - "These really lend themselves to test questions; I mean, it's a bunch of technical terms!"

- We talked about organizations and management stuff
    - How can engineers and managers come into conflict? What are their different loyalties/commitments?
    - What about WHISTLEBLOWING?
        - What does it mean, technically?
        - What are the 2 justifications for whistleblowing (i.e. harm-prevention and complicity-avoiding)?

- We then moved on to the CHALLENGER DISASTER!
    - What happened here? What's the general story?
        - Don't forget there are 2 parts: the event itself, and then the investigation
        - Who/what was involved, particularly in the investigation into the disaster?
    - Who's Boisjoly? Was he a whistleblower?
    - What's Harry Collins' take?
    - What did Feynman do?

- There was a chapter on HONESTY
    - Why is it wrong to tell lies from utilitarian, deontological, and virtue-based positions?
    - What kinds of dishonesty are there BESIDES just lie-telling?
    - Intellectual property - what kinds are there?
    - Dishonesty in research - what are its different forms? (e.g. plagiarism, ways of spoofing the data, etc.)
    - Conflicts of interest: what are these, how can they arise, and how can we avoid them?
        - This is one of the most practical, important ideas from this unit; "it's the standard-of-care of this half of the semester"

- There was a chapter on EXPERTISE
    - What did we cover on the lecture here?
    - What's the tension between "expertise" and "democracy?"
    - What does the book say about being an expert witness?
    - What does Collins say about "interactional expertise"?

- ...and another one on RISK
    - How does the textbook say engineering vs public ideas of risk differ?
    - What are the "utilitarian" and "capabilities" approach to risk?
    - What's required for "informed consent?"
    - Perrow's concept of "normal accidents" (as well as what the book says about them)
    - Schrader-Frechette's article about nuclear waste
    - Liability: how does this differ between "tort law" and "criminal law?"

- Penultimately, there's the ENVIRONMENT
    - What's the U.S. government's goal for environmental law right now?
    - What kinds of attitudes can companies take toward regulation?
    - Anthropocentrism vs ecocentrism
    - What kinds of cleanliness accounts are there?
    - What's sustainability?
    - Who's Rachel Carson?

- And, lastly, INTERNATIONAL ENGINEERING
    - Absolutist vs relativist approaches
    - What're the book's 6 suggestions for tackling boundary-crossing problems?
    - What are "boundary-crossing" problems?
        - What KINDS of boundary-crossing problems does the book name?
        - "These are SUPER important and'll definitely appear, so look at them!"

- Also, know the cases you read for recitation! They might make an appearance!

- So, that's what we covered! Before you go...
    - The School of Public Policy offers a minor in Philosophy - consider taking that!
    - Also, please fill out the CIOS course evaluation! It helps me, and I thank you in advance!
        - "...I mean, I have tenure, so you're not going to get me fired, but I do read them and adjust my class, and my bosses read them to evaluate me as a teacher"
        - In particular, if you know a professor who isn't tenured yet, fill out the CIOS! Those actually matter for them getting tenured!

- And with that, we'll end a bit early today - see you for the final!
