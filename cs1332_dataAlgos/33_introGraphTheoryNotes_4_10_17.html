//************Intro to Graph Theory - April 10th, 2017****************//
//*******************************************************************//

-Once again, HB is out today, so Raymond is taking over
-Exam 3 is THIS WENDNESAY! Practice exam, topic list, etc. is out, so you should have EVERYTHING you need to prepare!
-------------------------------------------------------

-What is this?
            *
           / \
          *   *
    -A binary tree? It COULD be, but even more generally, this is a GRAPH!
        -Once again, a graph is just anything where we have a set of "vertices"/"nodes" connected by "edges"
        -"V" is the # of vertices in the graph; "E" is the # of edges
            -So, when we're dealing with graph algorithms, we'll measure Big-O in terms of O(v) and O(n)
    -The DENSITY of a graph is the ratio of edges to vertices
        -An UNCONNECTED graph is a graph that has NO edges (its just a set of points); it has the minimum density a graph can have (i.e., zero)
        -A SPARSE graph is one where the density is small (i.e., the average degree is small)
    -Like we talked about on Friday, graphs can also be directed vs undirected, have a "degree" (# of edges connected to a vertex; for a directed graph, each vertex has an incoming and an outcoming degree), self-looping edges, etc.
        -Don't worry; we'll go over this vocab in recitation
    -Finally, it can also be VERY useful if we're allowed to WEIGHT the edges/ vertices of the graphs
        -When we weight VERTICES, they tend to be called "labels;" it is FAR more common to weigh edges instead of vertices
        -e.g. behind the scenes, Google Maps is basically a very complicated graph, where the edges have "weights" of the distances between cities/ locations

-So, let's say we have this graph:

    A--&gt;C
    | /
    B---D

    -How could we represent this graph? One way is with an ADJACENCY LIST
        -We list each vertex, and then, for each vertex, we have a list of the edges it's connected to
        -e.g.:
            A -&gt; B,C
            B -&gt; A,C,D
            C -&gt; B
            D -&gt; B
        -For a WEIGHTED graph, we could use a dictionary to hold the edge weights, or we could have the edges we store in this list be objects

    -ANOTHER way is with an ADJACENCY MATRIX, where we have a "V X V" matrix of the vertices, where one dimension is input and the other is output
        -The entries in this matrix say what weight the edges have; if it's 0, then that edge doesn't exist
        -Here, let's say the left side is the input
               A B C D
            A  0 4 3 0
            B  4 0 1 1
            C  0 1 0 0
            D  0 1 0 0

    -So, when do we want to use one over the other?
        -If we have a SPARSE graph, then the adjacency matrix will have a lot of empty spaces / wasted space, so we should use the LIST!
        -If we have a DENSE graph, then the matrix will give us O(1) look-up time, so we should use the matrix

-So, now let's get into some of the algorithms involving graphs
    -Let's start with node "traversals," where we have this problem: we have a "START" node that we start from, and we want to find a given "END"/ targest node
    -We'll start off with 2 well-known algorithms: depth-first search, and breadth-first search
        -These both work for weighted/unweighted AND directed/undirected graph

        A---B (B is also connected to D, but that's hard to draw in ASCII)
       / \
      C---E
       \
        D---F

    -In DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH (DFS), we have two external data structures: a stack where we keep track of the current node's neighbors (the "to be looked at" stack), AND a hashmap/other structure where we keep track of the nodes we've already visited
        -So, we start at the start node, add the start node to the "visited" list, and add all of the nodes that START is connected to to the stack
        -We then pop the top node off of the stack, add it to the visited list, and then look at all of the current node's neighbors
            -If the neighbor is already in the "visited" list, we ignore it and do NOT add it to the stack
            -If the node in the stack that we POPPED (e.g. are visiting) is already in the "visited" list (aka, we added a duplicate node to the stack), then we ignore it and pop off the next node
        -We keep going until we visit the node that we're looking for
            -Missed whether or not this is when we find it as a NEIGHBOR, or actually visit it on the stack; probably in the slides
    -So, at a high level, it just picks a path (more-or-less at random) and goes
    -In this raw form, we're just finding out if the end node can be reached (i.e., that a path exists)
        -You can modify it slightly to find the actual path by keeping track of the nodes you've visited in a 3rd data structure, but that's rarely used since more efficient algorithms exist for FINDING the actual path

    - In BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH (BFS), it's actually the same process, but INSTEAD of using a stack we use a QUEUE!
        -This means that, say, if we start at A, then we'll visit all of A's neighbors first (B, C, and E) before we go outwards and visit and each of THEIR neighbors, etc.
    -Like in our DFS algorithm above, we have to include a 3rd data structure to actually get the path to this node, rather than just show the path exists
        -We can do this for both DFS and BFS, but it's a bit tricky to implement correctly, so we tend to not bother with it in this class

    -So, even though their processes are similar, these two methods behave VERY differently
        -DFS just picks a path and goes as far as it can before it has to turn back
        -BFS, on the other hand, expands gradually outwards
    -Both of these algorithms have the EXACT same efficiency: O(V + E)
        -In other words, on average, we're going to be visiting every node and edge
        -This is also the WORST CASE; we're literally visiting everything
    -So, these algorithms by themselves aren't extremely efficient, but ALMOST ALL of our later graph algorithms are based on these two
