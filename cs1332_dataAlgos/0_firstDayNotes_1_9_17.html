//********First Day of Class! - January 9th, 2017*********//
/********************************************************//

-QUIZ DUE WEDNESDAY!!! Just a quick check to make sure you understand basic Java concepts and are ready for this course.

-HIGHLY recommend reading textbook chapters 1, 2, &amp; 3; Chpt. 1-2 are review; 3 is where the new material comes in

-A Bit about our professor:
    -Mary Hudachek-Buswell (feel free to say Dr. HB)
    -Originally worked as a math Professor..."then I went to the dark side"
        -CS is HARD; it's one of the only subjects most people have NO prior experience with, and it can be downright counter-intuitive at times
            -"You're the brightest students in the world, but at some point, even if it's not this course, you WILL hit a wall and struggle to understand things. That's more than okay; it's expected. Keep at it. Ask for help. You'll pull through."
            -"Feel free to pull all-nighters. Sleep is overrated for you young people; that's what being old is for."
    -Has 2 kids; "Eventually, they'll reproduce..." - HB, 2017
    -Had a cat for 19 years. Then it died. And she got a dog. With heartworms.
        -Eventually, the dog got better, and the 18 months of taking care of the dog got rid of HB's fear of dogs.
            -...comparing fear of dogs before having one to prejudice against programming? Mildly odd metaphor, but hey, true enough
        -So, now has a dog named Jack that she can't pull herself away from.

-2 Sections of 300 students chock-full, so TA's are going to be pretty heavily utilized; more TA's are being hired

-1st part of the course is focused on data structures, 2nd on algorithms (mostly searching / sorting, but will try to reach as many topics as reasonably possible)

-Final exam schedule is ALREADY posted, so you have NO EXCUSE for missing your final
    -"Why am I telling you this now? Well, because honestly, this is the last time I'll see some of you all semester"

-OFFICE HOURS are by appointment; no office hours during the first week of score

-You *can* use any IDE you'd like, but the TA's are most experienced with IntelliJ for Java 8; if you want help with setting up the IDE, debugging the editor, etc., use

-GRADING: 80% is based on exams (3 exams + final); other 20% is homework
    -NO EXEMPTING THE FINAL (No Simpkins-ing your way out of this one)
    -However, homeworks are ESSENTIAL for understanding the material, as they're where you will code
        -Homework that doesn't compile / crashes immediately will recieve a zero;
    -NO LOW GRADES ARE DROPPED; everything counts, so take everything seriously
    -Exam retakes are NOT allowed except in genuine emergencies; if something truly prevents you from taking the test (death in the family, medical emergency, etc.), CONTACT THE DEAN OF STUDENTS ASAP
        -DON'T EMAIL HB DIRECTLY!!!; the dean has to handle accommodations for these sort of circumstances

    -Grading will be done fairly and quickly; the TA's are consistently excellent at getting things done fast and well, so give them all the credit for grading things (good or ill)

-ALL submissions will be checked for plagiarism
    -Fair collaboration is discussing ideas at a high level, drawing diagrams, discussing algorithms, etc.;
        -If you're sharing pseudocode (or even worse), YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR and can be reported for cheating
    -ALL SUBMISSIONS DONE THROUH T-SQUARE
        -"T-Square is unforgiving, so please, make sure you're checking what you've turned in"
    -ALL homeworks due at 11:55pm on Monday nights; can submit up to 4 hours late for a 25% penalty
        -Assignments should take an UNINTERRUPTED ~4 hours; 1 hour to learn the concept, 2-3 hours to actually code the problem, and (what MOST of you won't do) an hour to write down the MISTAKES YOU MADE and how you fixed them
            -This way, when you go back to review a data structure, you know what the roadblocks are

-Attendance isn't taken in lecture / recitation, but we obviously HIGHLY recommend you come to all of them if possible
    -I mean, it's not like you're learning more by skipping, are you?

-WILL cover recursion (right after teaching Queues and right before trees) even though it isn't listed, as many of the 1331 courses last semester ended up rushing through recursion faster than expected (and recursion is ESSENTIAL to many of the algorithms we'll learn)
    -The "yellow-shaded" parts of the "Units Covered" list on T-Square is what will be covered on the 1st test (SUBJECT TO CHANGE, so don't blow up at me if something else slips its way in there)
