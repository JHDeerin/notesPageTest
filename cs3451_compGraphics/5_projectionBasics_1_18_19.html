//****************** Projection Basics - January 18th, 2019 *****************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Okay, part A of project 1 has been released on Canvas - go forth, young 
minions!
    - Professor Turk also apologizes for his Canvas noobiness, which is nice
    - "This first part is pretty straightforward, but it never hurts to get 
    started bright and early"
- In the textbook right now, you should be in the Vision/Projection sections if 
you want to read along
-------------------------------------------------

- So, we started talking about "projections" at the end of last class, but what 
does that even mean?
    - Well, in geometry, projection is when we move a point/points onto some 
    subspace (e.g. a 2D line onto the 1D X-axis)
- In PARALLEL projection, all of the "projector" lines are parallel to one 
another, and we draw whatever the line hits
    - ...whereas in PERSPECTIVE projection, all those lines converge to a 
    point, more accurately mimicking how our eyes work
        - "Perspective is much more common for special effects, video games, 
        and so on, but parallel projection is useful for stuff like drafting, 
        where you're more concerned with howvthings line up"
        - These are NOT the only 2 projections in the world - there's actually 
        quite a few - but most of the other ones are pretty special purpose, 
        and much, much less common

- Projection is SUPER important, since it's how we get our 3D scenes out into 
our 2D monitors and eyeballs, but how does it actually work?
    - Let's start with parallel projection; think of it as putting a flat sheet 
    of glass into the scene, and then us peering in through that window
    - Pretend that this VIEW PLANE of ours is on the X-Y axes, so that one flat 
    side is facing +Z and the other's facing -Z, and its bottom axis is at Z=0
        - Now, all we have to do is project ALL of our points onto this sheet 
        i.e. onto the Z axis), so that all the points are mapped like this:

            P(x, y, z) ----&gt; P(x, y, 0)

        - "Are we done?" Well, not quite - we've mapped ALL the points to our 
        view plane, but our monitor is only so big - so, we have to do a 
        VIEWING TRANSFORMATION to figure out which points should actually be 
        on-screen
            - Basically, we should have a certain max width/height for our view 
            plane, and then a maximum range we can see, forming a cube/"viewing 
            volume" that contains all the points we want to actually draw
                - So, pretending the origin is at (0,0) in the bottom-left, we 
                want to map from the points on our view plane within a certain 
                left/right or top/bottom boundary to our actual screen's WINDOW 
                with a width/height
                - This is just mapping from one range to another! e.g.

                    X: [left, right] ---------&gt; [0, w]
                        x' = (x - left) * width/(right - left)
                    Y: [bottom, top] ---------&gt; [0, height]
                        y' = (y - bottom) * height/(top - bottom)
                    Z: ...well, this is thrown away in our screen's coordinates
                        - You might have to deal with clipping for points that 
                        are too far away, but this is often handled at the 
                        hardware level nowadays
        - "Now, I love our textbook, but it wants us to do EVERYTHING in 
        matrices...but I'll just tell you now, parallel projection can be done 
        with this ONE LINE of code to map x/y. It's much easier than dealing 
        with matrix multiplication."
            - Of course, matrix multiplication is MUCH more efficient, but this 
            is significantly easier to understand

- Perspective projection, on the other hand, is all about triangles and angles 
and all that fun stuff - "remember it from high school geometry 80 years ago?"
    - So, we'll have our virtual eyeball - the CENTER OF PROJECTION - at some 
    point in the grid, which we'll say is at (0, 0, -1), pointed straight down 
    the Z axis, with our view plane still at Z=0 (i.e. a bit ahead of our eye)
        - Now, if we want to draw some point (x,y,z), how do we get it onto the 
        view plane?
        - Well, since our view plane is at Z=0, we know the point is p(z) away 
        from the view plane
            - So, there's a BIG triangle from our COP to the point/Z-axis, and 
            a little triangle from the COP to the view plane

                         *
                      | /|
                      |/ |
                      /  |
                     /|  |
                    / |  |
                COP)--|--------- Z
                      |
                      Y

            - These are SIMILAR triangles, so they'll have the same angles!
            - Therefore, for the point p(x,y,z):

                y'/y = 1/|z|
                    =&gt; y' = y/|z|

            -Similarly,

                x' = x/|z|

            - "So, this division by Z tells us that things that are farther 
            away will seem smaller - great!"
                - Note that this absolute value for Z would mean that anything 
                behind us would appear in front of us - so we'll need to deal 
                with that in the "real world"

- One thing we need to also decide for this camera is how wide our 
field-of-view is (FOV) - this'll decide what parts of our view plane are 
actually visible!
    - "You can have separate horizontal/vertical FOVs, but for simplicity's 
    sake assume that we have a square screen right now, so they'll be the same"
    - Basically, this is the angle theta between the two extreme angles of our 
    view plane (i.e. the total angle of our view)
        - So, our triangle would have an angle (at the COP corner) of theta/2
        - ...which means, by definition, the farthest up/down the Y axis we can 
        see for a Z-distance of 1 is:

            maxY (or minY) = tan(theta/2)

        - So, to map this from the view plane to the screen, we're doing:

            [-maxY, maxY] ---------&gt; [0, 2*maxY] ------&gt; [0, height]

        - i.e,

            y'' = (y' + maxY) * height/(2*maxY)

                - Adding maxY to y' so that we get rid of negatives

- "So, perspective projection is a little more complicated than parallel, but 
it basically boils down to 3 equations"
- In the meantime, enjoy your weekend!
