//************** Arbitrary Rotations - January 23rd, 2019 ********************//
//**************************************************************************//

- "Greg recommends using matrices to implement projection and mapping to the 
screen - true or false?"
    - The fools. The answer is obviously C, conveniently hidden on the backside 
    of the paper
    - "...but really, don't use matrices. They're great for most stuff, but 
    noooooo, they're just too annoying to deal with for a first-time projection 
    assignment"
-----------------------------------------------------------

- So, the goal for today is to move away from just doing "axis-aligned" 
rotations, and instead to learn how to rotate around any vector we want
    - "The math here is actually pretty elegant, and will come in handy when we 
    need to deal with 3D cameras"

- First off, some quick pieces of math we'll need to recover from the past:
    - VECTOR NORMALIZATION - to make a vector unit-length, we just take the 
    vector and divide all of its components by its magnitude/length!
        - Remember, the magnitude/length of a vector is just sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + 
        z^2 + ...)
    - Now, the dot product between 2 identical unit-length vectors is always 1
        - On the other hand, the dot product between any 2 perpendicular 
        vectors is 0
    - ...and additionally, there's this operation you might remember called the 
    CROSS-PRODUCT, where we multiply 2 vectors and get a 3rd vector that's 
    orthagonal to both of the original ones
        - I won't derive it here, but to remind you, the cross-product equation 
        looks like this:

            V1 x V2 = (y1*z2 - y2*z1, z1*x2 - z2*x1, x1*y2 - x2*y1)

- Hopefully that was just review for all of you, but what're we aiming towards?
    - Well, let's suppose we're back in 2D land, and there's a unit-length 
    vector A pointing off in the first quadrant. Here's a puzzle: if we want to 
    rotate A to line up with the X axis, how can we do that?
        - Sure, we could do something with a rotation matrix and arctangents 
        and so forth, but there's a really neat solution that's simpler:

            1) Create another unit vector "B" perpendicular to A, such that:

                    B = (-ay, ax)

                - Is this always perpendicular? Well, yes!

                    A*B = a1*b1 + a2*b2 = ax*-ay + ay*ax = 0

                - In 2D, there's also another perependicular vector that would 
                also work - this would give us the same answer (although it 
                might possibly flip something?)

            2) Create a rotation matrix as the following:

                    R = [ax ay 0] = [ax  ay 0]
                        [bx by 0]   [-ay ax 0]
                        [0  0  1]   [0   0  1]

                - "For the positive and negatives, think of ax replacing cosine 
                and ay replacing sine"
                    - Why is the negative sign in the wrong place, then? 
                    Because this time we're rotating CLOCKWISE onto the x-axis, 
                    instead of counter-clockwise like we're used to
                - So, what does this get us when we multiply A by this matrix?

                    R*A = [ax  ay 0]   |ax|
                          [-ax ay 0] * |ay|
                          [0   0  1]   | 1|

                        = |ax^2 + ay^2 =  1|   |1|
                          |-ay*ax+ax*ay = 0| = |0|
                          |1               |   |1|

                - So, we get a unit vector pointing along the x-axis - which is 
                what we wanted!
            - But here's a question: if we multiply B by this matrix, what 
            would we get?
                - Well, it turns out that we'd rotate B onto the Y axis!
        - So, that's all we had to do - it's almost magically simple!

- "That's all well and good, Professor Turk, but how does it help us with 
rotations?" Well, let's try looking at this in 3D!
    - Let's say that A is now a 3D vector |ax, ay, az|, pointing off in space 
    somewhere, and we want to rotate a point around A - how can we do it?
    - Well, we're not - INSTEAD, we're going to break this down into 3 simpler 
    problems:
        1) We're going to rotate A onto the X-axis
        2) We're going to rotate about the X-axis (which we know how to do)
        3) We're going to rotate A back to its original positions
    - So, how do we do step 1?
        - Well, very similarly to what we did in the 2D case, we need to find  
        2 perpendicular vectors to A; to do this, we'll need:
            - A itself
            - N (some other vector that's not parallel to A - pretend we have 
            an easy way to find this)
            - B: the CROSS PRODUCT of AxN that's been normalized, and therefore 
            perpendicular to both of them!
            - and C, the cross-product of AxB (which should be unit-length if 
            we've normalized B)
        - So, we now have 3 orthoganal vectors A, B, and C - which we can now 
        use to create the following rotation matrix:

            R = [ax ay az 0]
                [bx by bz 0]
                [cx cy cz 0]
                [0  0  0  1]

            - Will this really rotate A onto the X axis? Well, yes!
                - The x-corrdinate of R*A will be one (dot product with itself)
                - The z/y coordinates of R*A will be 0 (dot product of A with 
                perpendicular vectors)

    - For step 2, then, we'll just rotate about the X axis, which we already 
    know how to do!
    - ...but then, for step 3, we need to undo our first rotation. How do we do 
    that?
        - Well, we need the inverse of our first matrix! "But it's a 4x4 matrix 
        - wouldn't that be annoying to solve?"
            - Normally, yes, it would be - but in the very special case of an 
            ORTHONORMAL matrix like we've got here, it turns out that the 
            matrix's transpose IS its inverse!

            R^-1 = Rt = [ax bx cx 0]
                        [ay by cy 0]
                        [az bz cz 0]
                        [0  0  0  1]

    - SO, our final rotation matrix around some arbitrary vector A looks just 
    like this:

            Ra = Rt * Rx * R

- A quick side-note: an easy way to find N, given our starting vector A, is the 
following:

        getN(vector A):
            if (ax == 0):
                N = (1, 0, 0)
            else
                N = (0, 1, 0)

    - "Every method I've seen for finding this vector N has some sort of 
    if-statement, implicit or otherwise. This confused me for awhile, but then 
    it dawned on me: it's just a special case of the hairy ball theorem from 
    topology (which basically says a vector field on a ball has to have a pole 
    somewhere)...which I don't expect ANY of you to know for tests or anything, 
    but that was the epiphany I had."

- Here's a problem that seems unrelated, but is actually very tied to this 
rotation stuff: how do we put a camera in our 3D scene at any position, pointed 
in any direction?
    - We've learned how to deal with projections and camera stuff when we're at 
    the origin, pointed down a single axis - but sometimes life gets boring, 
    and we want to see the world from other angles
    - As it turns out, specifying the camera's position really does just take 3 
    numbers: x, y, and z. It's just a point in space
    - ...but how do we specify which way we're pointing? Well, the most obvious 
    thing would be to have another 3D vector for which way we're facing...
        - ...but that's actually more than we need! Remember a globe? We can 
        specify ANY direction on that globe using just latitude and longitude, 
        since we don't need to care about the vector's length!
            - For the same reason, a unit vector technically carries more 
            information than we need - if we wanted to, we could figure out 
            where it was with just 2 things
    - For a camera, we'll call these values the AZIMUTH and ELEVATION
- We also need a 6th number: the "orientation" number, that basically just 
tells us which direction/axis is "up" in our world
    - But many graphics libraries require us to give up to NINE numbers! What 
    gives? Well, skipping some of the details, it's for convenience sake so 
    that we don't have to calculate the aximuth/elevation when passing them to 
    the functions

- On Friday, we'll dig a bit deeper into HOW we're going to implement this - in 
the meantime, read the textbook for the camera sections, and I'll see you then!
