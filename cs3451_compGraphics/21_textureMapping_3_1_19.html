//******************* Texture Mapping - March 1st, 2019 *********************//
//**************************************************************************//

- February officially went cold on the operating table, so now it's March's 
turn! Give it a hand!
---------------------------------------------------------------

- Alright, we started talking about texture mapping on Wednesday - let's take a 
look at the gory details!
    - As mentioned, there are 3 steps to this: interpolating the S/T values 
    across the polygon, looking up the color at that point, then rendering it

- Let's begin at the beginning with interpolating the S-T values
    - Now, sadly, perspective projection makes this a little more complicated 
    than straight-up Goraud interpolation; we instead do the following steps:

        1) Divide S/T by |Z| to get s' and t'
        2) Interpolate s' and t' linearly during rasterization, just like 
        Goraud!
        3) Divide by Z' per-pixel
        4) Look up the color of the textured surface

    - If we don't do this, we get weird effects where the texture looks like 
    it's sliding around from different perspectives, etc.; we can't just 
    interpolate

- Texture lookup should be easy though, right? We just take color of our 
texture at the given S/T value, right?
    - NOPE! If we just did that and took the nearest color in the texture to 
    our coordinates, we'd get a blocky/pixelated effect, which usually isn't 
    desirable
    - To fix this, we'll instead use BILINEAR INTERPOLATION to take the 
    weighted average of these colors
        - For instance, let's suppose we have a tiny 4x4 texture image - 
        "remember, we're using S and T coordinates, not x and y"
        - If we have an S-T coordinate of, say, (1.7, 1.2), then instead of 
        just taking the color of pixel (2, 1) and calling it a day, we'll 
        instead interpolate between the colors of the 4 nearest pixels (i.e. 
        (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2))
            - Here, we'll have a ratio "a" for our percentage distance to the 
            right pixel (e.g. in this case, 1.7 - 1 / (2 - 1) = 0.7), and "b" 
            for the percentage towards the top pixel (i.e. 1.2 - 1 / (2 - 1) = 
            0.2)
            - With this, the bottom horizontal color "r0" and the top 
            horizontal color "r1" will be found as weighted averages for the 
            top/bottom pairs, e.g.:

                r0 = r00 + a*(r10 - r00)
                r1 = r01 + a*(r11 - r01)

            - Then, the final color will be the interpolated average of THOSE 
            averages using the vertical ratio:

                r = r0 + b*(r1 - r0)

- This interpolation is ESPECIALLY important when we're close to an object, 
where the blockiness of our textures becomes really obvious (known as "texture 
magnification")
    - The opposite of this is texture MINIFICATION, where a texture is so far 
    away that only a few pixels of it are showing on-screen
        - The problems with this minification problem aren't as obvious, but 
        they're definitely there!
            - Imagine you're on a spaceship that's blasted off from earth, and 
            you're watching the earth shrink smaller and smaller in the 
            rear-view mirror (...of your spaceship...yes...) - we'd imagine 
            that the earth should be predominantly blue and green and white, 
            right?
            - But if we don't properly shrink the texture as you get farther 
            away, the colors from the texture will get chosen at random, and 
            it'll "sparkle" as we get really far away and appear noisy
                - In extreme cases, they can result in Moire patterns for 
                textures with parallel lines (which is fun, but NOT what we 
                want)
    - How do we deal with this? Basically, we'll create multiple textures of 
    different sizes, known as "MIP-MAPPING" or an "image pyramid"
        - Mip-mapping, specifically, is a technique created by Lance Williams, 
        where we successively scale down our texture while averaging its pixels
            - For instance, if we start out with a 128x128 pixel texture, we 
            would create a smaller 64x64 version by making each new pixel's 
            color the average of its corresponding 2x2 group of 4 pixels in the 
            original
            - Then, we'd create a 32x32 image from the 64x64 one, then a 16x6 
            one...etc.
        - The image pyramid technique comes from a different way of viewing 
        this as "stacking" these different sized images together
            - ...and if we ALSO use our different image-size "layers" to 
            calculate the color of our texture (i.e. we interpolate between the 
            next-largest layer's color, using a distance-based factor as our 
            ratio), we end up with TRILINEAR interpolation, which helps prevent 
            the "sparkling effect" event more
    - How do we choose which size texture to use at a given time? Well, to be 
    hand-wavey about it, it's based on a function of your distance from the 
    texture
        - To give some more detail, what we're trying to mimic with all this 
        work is - for a given pixel on our monitor - to "project" that square 
        pixel from screen space onto the surface where our texture is, then 
        pretending that stretched/distorted pixel is on our texture itself 
        (i.e. in "texture space") and finding the average color it should be
        - To approximate this, we'll pretend that projected pixel is an 
        ellipsoid, calculate how "stretched" the ellipse is on its two axes, 
        and say the distance factor "d" is ~= sqrt(ds/dx^2 + dt/dy^2)
    - Furthermore, though, how do we STORE all these extra textures 
    efficiently? Lance Williams came up with a decent way of doing it:
        - Each image has 3 color channels, right (RGB)? Well, we'll make a new 
        image and divide it into fourths, then put our original image's RGB 
        values SEPARATELY into a box for each color, with the fourth square 
        left empty; we'll then repeat this process for the smaller texture, 
        putting it in the empty square, then repeat...

- Some of you might end up taking classes latter that talk about using 
"low-pass filters" (e.g. the Gaussian filter) to blur these image colors in a 
more sophisticated way than the bilinear interpolation we're using

- Now, mipmaps are great and efficient and supported by most graphics cards 
today at a hardware level, but they're not the only game in town by a longshot 
- there are other, more elaborate methods that try to have better quality
    - Similarly, there're LOADS more color interpolation techniques than just 
    bilinear vs trilinear that try to be more performant, or better-looking, 
    etc.

- Switching gears a bit, in raytracing, reflections were GREAT - we got them 
almost for free! - but they're harder to do for real in raster rendering. 
Instead, we'll try to cheat and fake our reflections with "cubemaps"
- We'll talk about that - and more! - on Monday
