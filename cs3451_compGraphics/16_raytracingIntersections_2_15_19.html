//************* Raytracing Intersections - February 15th, 2019 **************//
//**************************************************************************//

- This is the lull before the wave of work...is that a scientifically correct 
description?
    - *One Google search later* Ah, this is truly the trough before the crest 
    (unless we're talking about my emotional state, in which case: reverse the 
    terms, reader)
    - Wherefore bringeth such labor much strain and stress upon us mortals? 
    Soft, what cause moves us to make so much of passing moments, and to heap 
    our souls on idols of the world?
        - (...yeah.)
- THE SCREEN HAS CHANGED. INITIATE PROFESSOR TURK ACTIVATION SEQUENCE.
    - PERFORMING QUESTION ANSWERING SEQUENCE IN 3...2...1...
        - Okay, for homework 2b:
            - Object instancing just means creating multiple copies of an 
            object, using the matrix stack to move/position them in different 
            ways
--------------------------------------------------------------

- Alright, yesterday we started talking about ray tracing, and how it's the 
favored technique for animators - "but, like, who?"
    - Blue Sky Animation, who created the Ice Age movies, started using Ray 
    Tracing alllllll the way back to the first Ice Age movie 
    - Pixar actually was late to the ray tracing game - they didn't start 
    predominantly using Ray tracing until "Monsters University" in 2013!
        - They did use it for small bits in previous films (reflections in 
        "Cars," etc.), but not predominantly by any means
    - Literally EVERY special effects company since ~2005 uses ray tracing for 
    the vast majority of their effects

- We also started talking about how SURFACES are defined in ray-tracing, and 
how they're usually defined using implicit equations to help us tell when a ray 
collides with them
    - For a unit sphere, for instance, we usually define it with the implicit 
    equation:

            x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1

        - If we want to calculate where the ray pointing in direction (dx, dy, 
        dz) and of length "t" actually intersects the sphere, then we can 
        change this equation to:

            (x0 + t*dx)^2 + (y0 + t*dy)^2 + (z0 + t*dz)^2  - 1 = 0 

        - Simplifying a bit, we can rewrite this equation as:

            t^2*(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2) + 2t*(x0dx + y0dy + z0dz) + x0^2+y0^2+z0^2 
            - 1 = 0

        - This is a quadratic equation, since x0/y0/z0 are all constants! So, 
        we can solve for t using the quadratic formula!

                t = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
            - This +/- means that there are TWO points where the ray intersects 
            the sphere's surface: one through the front of the sphere, and the 
            other out the back!
                - It's like a severe bullet wound - it goes in, but it must 
                also come out!
                    - ...there are probably alternative analogies
                - (Professor Turk's microphone died; he promptly began 
                rummaging through his backpack saying "Here battery, battery, 
                battery...")

        - ...and finally, for a general sphere of radius "r", centered at (xc, 
        yc, zc), we'll define it as:

                (x-xc)^2 + (y-yc)^2 + (z-zc)^2 = r^2
                
            - Now, graphics programmers don't like calling square roots, since 
            they're MUCH more computationally intensive then multiplication! 
            So, we usually just compare the result against r^2 instead of r if 
            we cna get away with it

- That's great for a sphere and everything, but how do we figure out where a 
ray intersects with any polygon in general?
    - Well, a polygon is a 2D shape, right? So maybe we can simplify this 
    problem by projecting our ray onto the 2D plane the polygon lies in, and 
    then figure out the 2D problem of if the point lies within that polygon
    - So, ONE way of figuring this out is to:

        1) Calculate the ray's intersection with the infinite 2D plane the 
        polygon lies in
        2) Project the triangle/polygon and the point of intersection onto that 
        2D plane
        3) Figure out if, in 2D, the intersection point is inside the polygon 
        (the "point-in-polygon" test)

- So, that sounds like a plan!...but how do we calculate the intersection of a 
ray with a 3D plane, anyway?
    - Sure enough, we can define a plane implicitly in 3D with the following 
    equation:

            ax + by + cz + d = 0

        - Basically, what's going on here is that d is a vector that defines 
        the position/center point of the plane, and the vector (a,b,c) is a 
        vector that's normal to the plane
    - To calculate where the ray INTERSECTS, we'll again factor the ray into 
    this equation:

            a(x0 + t*dx) + b(y0 + t*dy) + c(z0 + t*dz) + d = 0 =&gt;
            t*(a*dx + b*dy + c*dz) + ax0 + by0 + cz0 + d = 0 =&gt;
            t = -(ax0 + by0 + cz0 + d) / (a*dx + b*dy + c*dz)

        - So, we can solve for t - great! HOWEVER, what if the denominator of 
        this equation ends up being 0? That's not allowed, so how do we prevent 
        it?
            - Well, since (a,b,c) is the normal vector to the plane, and 
            (dx,dy,dz) is the direction of the ray, the denominator is actually 
            the dot product of those two vectors - and if it's zero, that means 
            the the ray is perpendicular to the normal and PARALLEL to the 
            plane, so we can just assume it doesn't hit!
        - From there, we can 

- Alright, that's the intersection figured out, but how do we handle the 2D 
projection part of this?
    - So, we know where the intersection point is on our 3D plane

- And then, finally, we have to figure out if our point is inside the triangle 
- easy right?
    - Well, it's pretty easy for us to just look at a point and say "that's 
    inside something" or "that's outside something" - but when we try to think 
    about HOW we do this, it isn't obvious! So how do we tell our computer to 
    do this?
        - One bad way is the CROSSING test, where you shoot a ray out from the 
        point and count how many times it intersects a line in the polygon
            - The idea is that if the point is inside the polygon, it will only 
            cross the polygon's lines ONCE, but if it's outside it'll either 
            cross twice (entering one side and leaving the other) or not at all
            - But this misses an important edge case: if the point's ray is 
            tangent to the polygon, this method will falsely think it's inside!
        - A slightly better way is the WINDING METHOD: we draw 3 rays out from 
        the corners of the triangle (or 4 for a square, etc.), and count up the 
        angles the rays make with each other while going ONLY IN ONE DIRECTION 
        (clockwise or counter-clockwise)
            - If the point is inside the polygon, we can draw all ray-angle 
            pairs by just moving in a circle, so the angles won't cancel out 
            and'll be some non-zero value (almost always the sum of the 
            polygon's internal angles)
                - HOWEVER, if the point is outside of the polygon, the last 
                angle/ray pair will have to go backwards in the opposite 
                direction, which'll cancel out and result in a total angle sum 
                of 0
            - This method has problems too, though: what if the point is on a 
            line? Is it inside or outside? That now becomes inconsistent! And 
            it's pretty cumbersome, too
        - The method Professor Turk recommends, then, is the HALF-PLANE test
            - Here, we draw a line (our "plane") for EACH side of the triangle, 
            and say that the point is "positive" if it's to the left of the 
            line (i.e. towards the inside of the triangle) and "negative" if 
            it's to the right (i.e. outside the triangle)
                - If the point is negative for ANY of the lines, then it can't 
                be inside the polygon
                - Otherwise, if it's positive for all of them, it must be 
                inside the triangle!

- On Monday, we'll give the actual equation for doing the half-plane test - 
keep on until then!
