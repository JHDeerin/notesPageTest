//*********** Corner Polyhedra Representation - March 15th, 2019 ************//
//**************************************************************************//

- Spring Break is nearly upon us, and the attendance in the room is reflective 
of the fact
    - I count 43/150 people in class today - which is actually pretty good!
    - BUT WE'VE LOST LUKE! WAGH!
        - Nevermind, Luke get!

- Now, for your homework, let's go back to finding the intersection points
    - To find the intersection with the flat, HORIZONTAL plane (which we'll 
    assume for THIS homework), you'll plug the ray into the equation:

            r0.y + dir.y*t = plane.y + coneHeight

        - Solve for T, find the intersection point, and make sure the point is 
        within the cone's radius - done!
            - The surface normal is REALLY easy, then - it'll just be pointing 
            straight up!
------------------------------------------------------------------

- Now, we were going through different polyhedra representations on Wednesday, 
and got through 2 of them: the "Polygon Soup" and "Shared Vertex" schemes. 
Let's keep going!

- Yet another method is the CORNERS method
    - This method ONLY works for objects entirely composed of triangles, but it 
    works really well for them
        - It was actually invented by another professor here at Georgia Tech: 
        Jarek Rossingnac!
    - The basic idea is that we say each triangle's vertex has a "corner," with 
    3 corners per triangle - but it's NOT the same thing as a vertex
        - Similar to the Shared Vertex table, we'll create a GEOMETRY TABLE 
        with the (x,y,z) coordinates of each vertex:

                [(x1, y1, z1),
                 (x2, y2, z2),
                    (...)     ]

        - We'll then have a VERTEX TABLE with a list of vertex indices, like 
        this:

                [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, ...]

            - Each group of 3 vertices in this table defines a triangle; so, 
            the 1st triangle is made up of corners (0,1,2), the 2nd triangle is 
            (1,0,3), etc.
                - So, for a given corner index "corner" in this list, it'll 
                belong to triangle # (floor(corner / 3))
                    - From this, we can easily get from a particular corner to 
                    a particular triangle!
            - IMPORTANTLY, the order of these vertices in each triangle should 
            respect orientation (e.g. always being counter-clockwise)
                - As you're going to see, this allows us to find adjacent 
                triangles
                - How do we make sure all these triangles are oriented the same 
                way? That's actually a little bit complicated, but it can be 
                done - let's ignore that question for now
            - Using this table, we can say the "next corner" in a triangle will 
            be:

                    corner.next = 3*corner.triangleNum + ((c + 1) % 3)

                - "Greg, what the heck is this doing?" Well, it's saying that 
                to find the next vertex of a given corner, we'll jump to the 
                start of that corner's triangle, then (using the modulus) 
                rotate to that corner in the triangle, then one more
                    - Similarly, to find the previous corner, we'll just find 
                    the "next-next" corner (literally corner.next.next)
        - Finally, we'll have a 3rd table: the ADJACENCY INFORMATION, or the 
        "Opposite Table," telling us which triangles are next to one another
            - To do this, we just have to add one more piece of information to 
            each corner: "corner.opposite," which gets us the ID of the 
            opposite corner
                - What's the opposite corner? Well, if we have 2 triangles that 
                share a base, then the "opposite" corners A/B are the 2 that 
                don't share a vertex:

                             /|\
                            / | \
                         a /  |  \ b
                           \  |  /
                            \ | /
                             \|/
                        
            - If we have the Vertex Table, this actually isn't too hard to 
            compute! Here's how we do it:

                    for each corner a:
                        for each corner b:
                            // NOTE: "corner.vertex" means vertexTable[corner] 
                            if (a.next.vertex == b.prev.vertex AND 
                            a.prev.vertex == b.next.vertex):
                                opposite[a] = b
                                opposite[b] = a

                - So, if the corners share the same adjacent vertices, it means 
                they must each be the "3rd point" in their triangle, and that 
                their triangles are adjacent, so they're opposite!
            - But why do we care about knowing these opposite corners? What do 
            we "get" from this? Well, a LOT!
                - We can calculate the corner's left/right neighbors really 
                easily:

                        corner.rightNeighbor = corner.next.opposite
                        corner.leftNeighbor = corner.prev.opposite

                    - This gets us another corner,yes - but it's a corner 
                    that's INSIDE the right/left adjacent triangle, and we can 
                    get that triangle's ID really easily!
                - We can also calculate the SWING of the triangle, which lets 
                us rotate to all the triangles around a given vertex:

                        corner.swing = corner.next.opposite.next

                - This means we can process all the triangles around a given 
                vertex super easily, which is difficult in Shared Vertex 
                schemes and straight-up IMPOSSIBLE in Polygon Soup!
        - It takes a little while for this representation to sink in (remember 
        that corners are NOT the same thing as vertices - vertices can be 
        shared between triangles, corners can't), so why are we spending so 
        much time on its gory details?
            - Well, because it is a legitimately elegant way of storing 
            triangle meshes: it's compact, but it gives you a LOT of 
            information for not a lot of storage
                - ...there's also a decent chance this'll reappear on an exam 
                sometime in the near future, but surely you don't care about 
                THAT...

- Alright, and with that: break time! See you all in 9 or 10 days!
